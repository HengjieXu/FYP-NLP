Samsung has received 733 reports of washing machines experiencing \u201cexcessive vibration or the top detaching from the washing machine chassis,\u201d according to a Nov. 4 statement from the U.S. commission. There have been nine related reports of injuries, the commission said.\nSamsung said in a Nov. 4 statement that it will offer consumers a free in-home repair of the machine, or a rebate that can be used when consumers buy a new machine. For more recent purchases, consumers can get a full refund.\nThis is another setback for the company, which has recently ended production of its flagship Galaxy Note 7 smartphone following a global recall, a debacle estimated to ultimately cost more than $6 billion.\u00a0\nSamsung also said Friday that about 85 percent of its recalled Galaxy Note 7 smartphones in the U.S. have been replaced. The company announced an expansion in the U.S. of a software patch intended to encourage the return of the remaining devices.\nSamsung said that the patch caps the Note 7\u2019s battery life capacity at 60 percent and frequently notifies users of the recall. The company has urged the return of the phones since early October, when reports surfaced of the devices overheating and catching fire. The patch has already been issued in Europe and South Korea.\n",

        "content": "Turmoil at two of South Korea\u2019s biggest companies is fueling scrutiny of the family-run conglomerates that dominate the nation\u2019s economic production. They\u2019re known as chaebols, and activist shareholders have long pressed to unravel their complex and insular corporate structures. While Samsung and Lotte Group are going through very different crises -- Samsung had to abandon a popular smartphone due to batteries that caught fire; Lotte\u2019s founding family faces trial on charges of embezzlement and tax evasion -- both now face questions about corporate leadership, governance and culture.\nIt\u2019s a corporate dynasty. The grandchildren of Samsung\u2019s founder, for instance, control a sprawling empire with interests in electronics, shipbuilding, construction, insurance, theme parks, advertising and film production - nearly 60 businesses in all. Chaebols differ from conglomerates in the U.S. and elsewhere both in terms of their out-sized influence on the country\u2019s economy and their dynastic rule.\nChaebols, which means \u201cwealth cliques\u201d in Korean, is widely believed to have been influenced by Japan\u2019s zaibatsus -- both share the same Chinese characters and meaning. Like the chaebols, zaibatsus were family-controlled conglomerates that dominated Japan\u2019s economy until they were disbanded by the U.S. government shortly after World War II. In Korea, establishing chaebols was viewed as a key way to fast-track the country\u2019s economic development. Shortly after taking over the government in a military coup in 1963, Park Chung-hee, father of the current president, launched a modernization effort driven by \u201cguided capitalism\u201d in which government-selected companies undertook major projects often financed with government-backed loans.\nThere are 45 conglomerates that fit the traditional definition of a chaebol, according to Korea\u2019s Fair Trade Commission. To understand their economic influence, the top 10 chaebols own more than 27 percent of all business assets in South Korea.\nWhile chaebols were key economic drivers of the the country\u2019s stunning growth, ordinary South Koreans are increasingly questioning the consolidation of wealth among a handful of families and the stifling effect they\u2019ve had on small businesses and startups. Amid public criticism, regulators and investors have been pushing to unravel cross-shareholdings and revamp governance of the chaebols. Foreign investors in particular have said the lack of transparency in the management structure has led to a so-called \u201cKorea discount\u201d in which stocks of chaebol affiliates trade at lower prices than comparable companies overseas.\nYes, the first major call for change came in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis in 1997 that the public blamed on the wanton growth of the chaebols. The cozy relationship that chaebols enjoyed with government and banks led to managers -- free from oversight by banks or the demands of profitability -- wasting funds on uneconomic projects while starving potentially more productive and innovative parts of the economy of resources. At the height of the crisis, more than 3,500 companies filed for bankruptcy every month. After a humiliating bailout by the International Monetary Fund, more stringent banking regulations were imposed including preventing chaebol affiliates from guaranteeing each other\u2019s loans, making it harder for weaker businesses to survive.\nBillionaire activist Paul Elliott Singer has proposed that Samsung split into an operating company and a holding company and add three independent board members, moves that would simplify the ownership structure. Samsung insiders have said that the proposal is in line with the family\u2019s broader plan. As for Lotte, its chairman has said the company is looking at reducing cross-shareholdings and creating a holding company to be more transparent. Both chaebols are looking to restructure, at least on their own terms, rather than being forced by regulators.\nNot any time soon. Chaebols are so ingrained in Korea\u2019s social and economic fabric that some economists believe any attempt to unravel them completely could be catastrophic. The case in point is the difficulty that President Park Geun-hye has had in pushing for restructuring particularly at a time when the economy has been sluggish. Any attempt at chipping away at a chaebol has a direct bearing on the economy.\n",

Now comes the guessing game about what he\u2019ll do with it.\nOn Thursday, Lee officially joined a nine-person board at Samsung Electronics Co.,\u00a0whose botched roll out of the Galaxy Note 7 smartphone has delivered a blow to a premier tech brand and cost the company billions of dollars in profit.\u00a0The move gives the low-profile executive, also known as Jay Y., a big say over top management and strategic calls, including restructurings, mergers and asset sales.\nHis ascension comes on the same day that Samsung reported a sharp decline in profits, as the recall took its toll. Net income fell to 4.41 trillion won ($3.9 billion) in the September quarter; the debacle that may ultimately cost more than $6 billion. Shares in the company rose 0.4 percent at the close of trade in Seoul.\nLee, 48, is already vice chairman of Samsung Electronics and has gained influence since his father, Lee Kun-hee, suffered a heart attack and was hospitalized in 2014. The founding family controls Samsung Group, whose tentacles extend into financial services, hotels,\u00a0biopharmaceuticals and fashion, through a complex network of cross ownership. So in a way, Lee\u2019s elevation to the board of the flagship will be something akin to a coronation.\nSamsung\u2019s in a Battle to Stop It All Going Up in Flames: Gadfly\n\"We can now say that Lee\u2019s regime has officially begun,\" said\u00a0Lee Chaiwon, chief investment officer at Korea Value Asset Management Co. \"I think a new era is coming.\" Lee believes Jay Y.\u2019s enhanced influence will be an adrenaline shot for a company in crisis. \"The company will become more market-friendly,\" he said, predicting the new board member will \"quicken its restructuring process.\"\nSamsung Electronics has no shortage of challenges, urgent ones. In addition to mopping up after the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco, the younger Lee faces a threat from activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. that\u2019s pushing Samsung Electronics to simplify its ownership structure. The New York-based fund, founded by stock picker Paul Singer, also wants the company to add independent directors and dish out a special $27 billion dividend to investors.\n\u201cBeing a board member means management responsibility,\" said Heo Pil-seok, chief executive officer of Midas International Asset Management Co. \"The market will expect Lee to come up with some follow-up steps to settle the Note 7 problem.\"\nSamsung\u2019s management and board are \u201ccarefully reviewing\u201d all of Elliott\u2019s proposals, senior vice president Robert Yi told a conference call. After buying back more than 11 trillion won of stock since last year, the Suwon-based company plans to shed more light on its shareholder return policy next month, he said.\nFor a Quicktake on South Korea\u2019s chaebols, click here\nWhile about 400 investors attended the meeting to vote on Jay Y.\u2019s appointment, the man himself wasn\u2019t there. Instead it was Vice Chairman Kwon Oh-hyun and Co-Chief Executive Officer Shin Jong-kyun who spoke about the crisis and management shortcomings.\nShin said the number of incidents with the Note 7 was in the hundreds and Samsung was continuing to investigate as it revisits every aspect of its hardware, software and production processes.\n\u201cIt is not acceptable that we did not meet our own quality assurance standards,\u201d said Shin, a former head of the phone business. \u201cWe know we must work hard to earn back your trust and we are committed to doing just that.\u201d\nThen there\u2019s the broader sales slump at Samsung Electronics, which also makes semiconductors and display panels. The company is coping with a drop in LCD panel prices and lower-cost Chinese rivals in the television market.\u00a0Total third-quarter sales fell to 47.8 trillion won and the company could record its third straight year of decelerating annual revenue, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. For the coming year, Samsung said it\u2019s planning to spend a record 27 trillion won on plants and equipment as it boosts production of OLED displays.\nOwing to South Korea\u2019s\u00a0tradition of filial piety, it\u2019s been difficult for the younger Lee to take command since his father fell ill. That said, Lee attracted media attention in 2015 when he apologized on live television for a Samsung-owned hospital\u2019s failure to contain a Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome.\nFranz-Hermann Hirlinger, the first foreign outside director ever to serve at Samsung Electronics, remembers Lee as a young man who always sat in a corner with his back straight and hands neatly folded on his knees, quietly observing board meetings. Everyone in the room, including Hirlinger, knew that it was part of his training to succeed his father one day.\nThat day has arrived. And Lee is already drawing criticism. Sustinvest Inc., a Seoul-based proxy-advisory firm, said in a letter to shareholders this week that Lee isn\u2019t qualified to be on the board because he benefited from \u201cinter-affiliate\u201d transactions at the Samsung group.\n\u201cThere is a widespread expectation for Vice Chairman Lee to show that he is able to take charge and lead Samsung out of the crisis and usher in change,\u201d said Kim Sang-jo, a professor at Hansung University.\nPeople who have worked closely with Jay Y. describe him as a polar opposite of his larger-than-life father. The younger Lee is an affable, approachable man with a global view, who wants to modernize South Korea\u2019s largest business group, according to Hirlinger.\nIn his new and expanded role, Lee\u2019s performance will come under even greater scrutiny. \"Until now, Lee could just enjoy the good times and avoid the bad times and didn\u2019t have to take any legal responsibilities,\" said Chung with Chaebul.com. \"But if things like the Note 7 happens again,\" he said, \"many fingers will point at him.\"\n",

        "content": "This week, Samsung representatives are standing by at some of the world&apos;s busiest airports, ready to exchange Galaxy Note 7 phones for something new and less combustible. After dozens of fires, two recalls and the complete cancellation of the product, the U.S. government on Saturday warned that anyone knowingly bringing a Galaxy Note 7 and its potentially explosive battery onto a plane could be subject to criminal prosecution.\nThere&apos;s plenty of reason to blame Samsung for this debacle. It rushed the phone to market. It didn&apos;t subject the batteries to independent testing, as its competitors routinely do. It was slow to acknowledge the scale of the problem. And it failed to properly coordinate its response with regulators.\u00a0 \u00a0\nBut perhaps Samsung&apos;s biggest mistake was one common to many phone makers: In the race to make the slimmest devices possible, it created a product that can no longer be easily repaired or refurbished. For years, this trend has been harmful to consumers and the environment; now it&apos;s clear that it can hurt a manufacturer&apos;s bottom line and reputation, too.\nThe immediate problem with the Galaxy Note 7 is a manufacturing defect that makes its batteries prone to short-circuiting and combustion. That didn&apos;t need to be a fatal flaw: As recently as 2014, one of the top selling points for Galaxy Note phones was that a user could switch out the battery pack with ease. If the Note 7&apos;s batteries could have been quickly replaced, the toll of the current crisis would have been far smaller.\nIn 2015, however, Samsung began to transition away from replaceable batteries. It wanted to produce a thinner device, which made accessing interior components more difficult. And it wanted to make its phones waterproof, which required embedding batteries and made DIY repair a fantasy except for the most competent technicians. (One expert recently explained that replacing a Note 7 battery requires \"blasting the back of the phone with hot air, prying away the glass and pulling out a layer of components before going after the battery with a tiny plastic crowbar.\")Samsung&apos;s new approach offered one other advantage. Replacing batteries is now a high-margin business for phone makers. Apple charges $79 to swap out a battery on an out-of-warranty iPhone 6, even though replacement kits, complete with tools, can be found online for less than $30. Those who already have the tools -- such as the fast-growing independent phone-repair industry -- can purchase the batteries online for less than $10. Samsung had the same idea: It costs $45 for an authorized service center to swap out a battery for the premium S6. But many owners will simply upgrade instead of going through the trouble. And that&apos;s precisely what the manufacturers want: An overly expensive battery replacement is really just the starting point for upselling a new phone.\nThe Note 7 recall is a blunt reminder that, in a crisis, those harder-to-repair phones can become a vast liability. Instead of switching out 2.5 million batteries, Samsung is now preparing to \"dispose\" of 2.5 million phones, at a cost that will easily exceed $1 billion, not to mention long-term reputational damage.\nAnd the cost to the environment may be steeper. By one estimate, the average new phone requires 165 pounds of raw materials, including gold, copper, rare earths and oil. Even under the best circumstances, recyclers can recover only a small percentage of such ingredients. Samsung hasn&apos;t disclosed what it plans to do with all those recalled phones, but it&apos;s a safe bet that it will amount to an enormous waste.\nIt doesn&apos;t need to be this way. Manufacturers are fully capable of designing products for easier repairs, and some are doing so. When Apple designed the iPhone 7 to be water resistant, it didn&apos;t rely on adhesives but instead opted for repair-friendly gaskets and seals. FairPhone, a Dutch social enterprise, has sold tens of thousands of premium modular phones that allow customers to snap out batteries with ease. LG has carved out a profitable niche making high-end phones that do the same.\nThese companies are figuring out something that the auto industry realized years ago: There&apos;s a market for durable products that can be repaired and upgraded, either in a driveway or at a service center. Repairable devices can be a hedge against a Note 7-type recall. They also allow companies to make money over the lifespan of their products by selling replacement parts, while cementing long-term relationships with their customers. Auto dealerships mastered this art long ago. Samsung, when it finishes cleaning up the mess left behind by the Note 7, should try to do the same.\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\nTo contact the author of this story:          Adam Minter     at aminter@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story:          Timothy Lavin      at tlavin1@bloomberg.net\n",
