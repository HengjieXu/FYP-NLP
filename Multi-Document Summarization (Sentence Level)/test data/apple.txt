        "content": "Why Hasn't Apple Revolutionized TV Yet?\nEarlier this month, Apple Inc. poached the chief of Amazon&apos;s Fire TV unit to run its television operations. Timothy D. Twerdhal brings hardware and content experience to his new gig, and his hiring suggests a renewed focus on the Apple TV set-top box.\nTwerdhal&apos;s\u00a0arrival comes as the company tests\u00a0a new, fifth-generation Apple TV that it may\u00a0release as soon as this year. Internally codenamed \"J105,\" the new box will be capable of streaming ultra-high-definition 4K and more vivid colors, according to people familiar with the plans.\nThe\u00a0features will probably boost Apple TV sales as consumers increasingly upgrade to 4K television sets, but those\u00a0enhancements alone probably\u00a0aren&apos;t enough to\u00a0turn the gadget into a groundbreaking, iPhone-caliber product. Time and again, the people say, Apple engineers have been forced to compromise on\u00a0Apple&apos;s vision of revolutionizing the living room.\nEarly on,\u00a0the Apple TV was going to replace the clunky set-top boxes from the cable companies and stream live television. It never happened. The team debated bundling a gaming controller with the current\u00a0model\u00a0to better compete with Microsoft Corp.&apos;s Xbox and Sony Corp.&apos;s PlayStation. That didn&apos;t happen either. Originally, viewers were going to be able\u00a0to shout commands from the couch to the Apple TV. Instead they must talk to\u00a0the remote control.\nApple has essentially settled for turning the television set\u00a0into a giant iPhone: a cluster of apps with a store. \"That&apos;s not what I signed up for,\" says one of the people, who requested anonymity to talk freely about internal company matters. \"I signed up for revolutionary. We got evolutionary.\" Gene Munster, who covered\u00a0Apple for more than a decade\u00a0as a Piper Jaffray analyst and now runs Loup Ventures, echoes the criticism. \"Apple TV begs the question: Why does Apple do hobbies?\" he says. \"Either do it right or don&apos;t do it at all.\"\nApple CEO Tim Cook speaks about Apple TV in Cupertino, Calif., on Oct. 27, 2016.\nApple doesn&apos;t disclose how many Apple TVs\u00a0it sells, but Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri acknowledged in a recent interview that sales decreased year-over-year from the 2015 holiday season to this past 2016 holiday period. The research firm eMarketer says\u00a0the fourth-generation Apple TV\u00a0has steadily lost market share since its release in the fall of 2015; in January just 11.9 percent of connected television customers were using it, the research firm says, down from 12.5 percent in September. In part, the slide reflects competition\u00a0from Amazon and Roku, whose boxes do the\u00a0same and more for less money.\nWhile the Apple TV itself isn&apos;t critical to Apple&apos;s bottom line, it&apos;s central to the company&apos;s services business because increasingly the living room is where consumers buy, rent and consume media. Services represented almost $25 billion in revenue for Apple in the last fiscal year, making it the company&apos;s second biggest category\u00a0after the iPhone.\nApple declined to comment or make Twerdhal available for an interview. The shares fell less than 1 percent to $135.17 at 3:29 p.m. in New York.\u00a0\nThe Apple TV&apos;s history is a study in\u00a0gradualism. Previewed by Steve Jobs in 2006, the first box was designed simply to stream iTunes video from a Mac to a TV\u00a0set. The next version, launched in the fall of 2010, let\u00a0users stream content from the internet. The latest box was announced in September 2015, a few months later than originally scheduled. Widely considered an\u00a0improvement by consumers and product reviewers,\u00a0the Apple TV features the App Store, voice control and a glass remote that enables motion-controlled gaming, which for example lets players use the remote like a steering wheel for a car-racing title.\u00a0\nBut the latest Apple TV sells for\u00a0$149, more than twice as much as\u00a0its predecessor, $60 more than Amazon&apos;s Fire TV\u00a0and $20 more than the priciest Roku. What&apos;s more, little about the viewing experience has changed. Apple TV users still have to buy an individual episode via the iTunes Store,\u00a0pay extra for services like Hulu, or download an app tied to a particular channel and log in with an existing cable subscription.\nAn Apple TV is displayed after a product announcement in San Francisco, Calif., on Sept. 9, 2015.\nThe current\u00a0model was originally supposed to replace the cable box altogether. Early prototypes had connectors for a coaxial port, which\u00a0sends the live cable TV signal to televisions. Under this plan, Apple was to control the interface, collect fees from viewers and then share most of the revenue with the cable and media companies.\nA new TV app was to be\u00a0the main interface for accessing live shows and sports. But when the app was finally launched in December, it merely let viewers\u00a0access their iTunes video library and the iTunes Store, functions that already existed on the Apple TV. The key new element is a \"Watch Now\" panel, a Netflix-style repository of favorite movies or shows and recommendations for new ones. Some Apple engineers now regret\u00a0not making it possible to tailor the opening screen to viewer preferences\u2014classic movies for the family film buff, say, or food shows for the budding teenage chef. The idea never made it onto the engineering roadmap, and adding it now would require a lot of resources.\u00a0\nApple had a backup plan if it wasn&apos;t able to replace the existing cable box\u2014the much-ballyhooed \u00a0\"skinny bundle,\" a stripped down web service that would let viewers choose channels rather than paying for ones\u00a0they don&apos;t watch.\u00a0Apple proposed bundling the four main broadcast networks and a handful of cable channels as well as on-demand TV shows and movies for $30 to $40 a month. The media\u00a0companies were willing to engage with Apple due to concerns about the rise of online services like Netflix and the cord-cutting phenomenon.\nBut the two sides stumbled over cost, the composition of the bundles and negotiating tactics. The media companies blamed Apple&apos;s arrogance;\u00a0Apple blamed the media companies&apos; inflexibility. In the end, the talks fell apart, leaving Apple to\u00a0tout stripped-down bundles from Sony PlayStation and DirecTV. After the negotiations foundered, Apple&apos;s hardware team ditched the\u00a0coaxial port.\nThe Apple TV&apos;s software is also less ambitious than originally\u00a0envisioned. The current model\u00a0features an iPhone-like app grid, but designers had prototyped more novel interfaces. One idea, dubbed \"Intentions\" internally, put the four tabs in the center of the screen: three for the Apple TV&apos;s main content types (video, music, and gaming) and one for everything else. Another idea: letting viewers pull up previews of content by hovering on each icon\u00a0(a feature currently reserved for apps in the top row).\nTo a certain extent, the\u00a0Apple TV is handcuffed by its parent&apos;s\u00a0addiction to fat margins. Apple is constitutionally allergic to losing money on a product\u2014even if it can make up the difference by selling content. Some engineers initially believed the current\u00a0set-top box should be\u00a0capable of streaming 4K video, which offers about twice the resolution as the previous generation of high-definition TV. But 4K requires\u00a0a faster processor, which would have pushed up manufacturing costs. That would have forced Apple to accept a lower margin or charge more than the market would bear. Apple settled for a lesser chip that debuted back in 2014\u2014and no 4K. Likewise, not bundling a gaming controller was partially a cost-driven decision.\n\u2014With Lucas Shaw in Los Angeles\n(This story was corrected to say that content previews are currently reserved for on-screen apps in the top row.)\n",

        "content": "Apple Closes at Record High on Optimism for Next iPhone\n\u201cWe are always looking at acquisitions,\u201d\u00a0Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook told analysts last month. \u201cThere\u2019s not a size that we would not do.\"\nIt\u2019s a message he\u2019s increasingly stressed over the past year as investors question how the world\u2019s most valuable technology company plans to use its $246 billion cash pile to meet ambitious sales targets and expand into new markets, such as transportation.\nBut Apple has struggled for years to pull off bigger deals because of a series of quirks:\u00a0an aversion to risk, reluctance to work with external advisers like investment banks and inexperience in closing and integrating large takeovers, said people who have worked on acquisitions with the company. They asked not to be identified speaking about private\u00a0merger and acquisition deliberations.\n\u201cThe first step in M&A is having some conviction about what it is you want to do,\u201d said Eric Risley, managing partner at Architect Partners LLC who has negotiated deals with Apple. \u201cApple probably more than most feels that they\u2019re very capable of building things\" rather than buying them, he added. An Apple spokesman declined to comment.\nApple\u2019s biggest deal in its 41-year history was the $3 billion purchase Beats Electronics in 2014, followed by the $400 million acquisition of NeXT Computer in 1996. In Facebook Inc.\u2019s 13 years, it has made three acquisitions of at least $1 billion, including its $22 billion WhatsApp purchase. Google, founded in 1998, has done four such deals, while Microsoft Corp. has completed at least 10, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nInstead of closing big deals, Cook has so far focused on growing Apple\u2019s services businesses, including\u00a0Apple Music, the App Store and iCloud. That\u2019s beginning to work, with the company recently forecasting that annual revenue from those operations will top $50 billion by 2021.\nBut even here, some analysts and investors argue for a big acquisition, especially in online video streaming. Apple\u00a0has started distributing videos through the Music service, and pooling other providers\u2019 video in its mobile TV app, but it has no service akin to Netflix or Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s Prime Video.\nOn Friday, Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said Apple needs at least one big acquisition in online video. To reach its $50 billion target, the company must find an extra $13 billion in services revenue over the next four years -- beyond what it can generate itself. Netflix Inc. ended 2016 with sales of less than $9 billion, so even buying that business may not be enough, the analyst said.\nOther potential blockbuster Apple acquisition targets include Walt Disney Co. and electric carmaker Tesla Inc., Baird analyst William Power wrote in a recent note to clients.\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to have to pursue something bigger than a Beats-like acquisition,\" said Erick Maronak,\u00a0chief investment officer at Victory Capital Management, which holds Apple stock among its $55 billion under management.\nThe presidency of Donald Trump may spark tax reforms that free up more Apple cash to spend on takeovers. But so far, the company has tip-toed around the edges of some of the biggest transactions re-shaping the technology industry.\u00a0\nWhen AT&T Inc. agreed to purchase Time Warner Inc. for $85 billion in October, the telecom company was concerned Apple might make a competing bid, people familiar with AT&T\u2019s thinking said at the time. Apple had held tentative talks about a year earlier, but when the AT&T deal emerged, a person familiar with the technology giant\u2019s thinking said it wouldn\u2019t be able to pull together a competing proposal quickly enough.\nLast year, the company considered buying luxury carmaker McLaren Technology Group Ltd., people familiar with the discussions told Bloomberg at the time. Apple also had takeover talks with chip designer Imagination Technologies Group Plc, but said last year it wouldn\u2019t make an offer.\nApple\u2019s deals team is composed of about a dozen people under former Goldman Sachs banker Adrian Perica, and most acquisitions take place at the behest of the company\u2019s engineers. Product managers usually meet every month with Perica\u2019s team members to identify targets with attractive technology or talented engineers, according to a person familiar with the process.\nMicrosoft\u2019s deals team is not significantly bigger, and it still hired investment bank Morgan Stanley for its $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn last year, beating rival bidders including Salesforce.com Inc. and Facebook.\nAt Google, the corporate development team is led by Don Harrison and sometimes works on potential acquisitions with strategy experts working under Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler, not just technical staff. Other deals are carried out at the behest of founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin.\nApple often refuses to work with investment bankers appointed by the seller, preferring to deal directly with company management, according to people who have been involved in such negotiations. Apple also dictates terms and tells targets to take it or leave it, betting that the promise of product development support later and the chance of appearing in future iPhones are alluring enough, the people said.\nThat was the case when Apple acquired Metaio GmbH in 2015. Bankers appointed by the\u00a0augmented-reality firm to negotiate weren\u2019t allowed in the room, and while Metaio executives felt the offer was low, Apple\u2019s vision for the technology convinced them to sell, according to a person familiar with the discussions.\nApple\u2019s current M&A strategy works well for acquiring startups developing new technology that can be added to existing Apple products. It bought 15 to 20 companies per year over the last four years. But buying larger companies presents a different challenge, particularly if there are rival bids. Bankers often diffuse tension between bidders and targets, but Apple\u2019s approach can make that process difficult.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a swagger -- you may call it arrogance -- about the culture there,\u201d said Risley of\u00a0 Architect Partners. \u201cThey\u2019re used to being able to muscle their way in and get attractive economics.\u201d\nLarge acquisitions can also go wrong in big ways. After buying Nokia Oyj\u2019s handset business for $9.5 billion, Microsoft had to write down $7.6 billion of that value in 2015. Failures like that helped forge Apple\u2019s caution on larger deals, according to one of the people familiar with its thinking.\nThat attitude may need to change, according to some investors. After the AT&T-Time Warner deal, analysts\u2019 focus shifted to Netflix as the next target, even as the video streaming service says it\u2019s not up for sale. However, that company\u2019s shares are up about 60 percent in the past year, giving it a market value of more than $60 billion -- 20 times the cost of Apple\u2019s biggest deal.\n\"There are certain opportunities that they should probably be pursuing and if they wait too long they risk ceding ground to the first movers,\" Victory Capital\u2019s Maronak said.\n",

        "content": "Apple Closes at Record High on Optimism for Next iPhone\nApple Inc. is in discussions with China\u2019s BOE Technology Group Co. to supply next-generation displays for future iPhones,\u00a0a key component that\u2019s being provided by a Samsung Electronics Co. unit, people familiar with the matter said.\nApple\u2019s been testing BOE\u2019s active-matrix organic light-emitting diode screens for months but hasn\u2019t decided if it\u2019ll add the Chinese company to its roster of suppliers, one of the people said, asking not to be named talking about private negotiations. BOE, one of the country\u2019s largest screen makers, is spending close to 100 billion yuan ($14.5 billion) building two AMOLED plants in the southwestern province of Sichuan in anticipation of future business. Talks are at an early stage and it\u2019s unlikely to supply the next iPhone, but BOE is banking on outfitting the one in 2018 or later, the person said.\nIf BOE is selected for OLED, it will become the first known future supplier of the next-generation screens to Apple outside of South Korea and Japan -- a triumph for a Beijing-based company best known for computer and TV displays. The U.S. company is exploring alternatives to address a global shortage of OLED displays as it prepares to\u00a0adopt the sharper, more power-efficient technology for its next iPhones, catching up with rivals such as Samsung and Huawei Technologies Co.\nApple declined to comment, and BOE declined to comment on talks with customers.\nThe display is one of the most expensive components of a smartphone. OLED screens are more difficult to produce, making Apple beholden to suppliers still working to manufacture the displays in mass quantities. The world\u2019s four biggest suppliers of smartphone displays -- Samsung Display Co., Sharp Corp., LG Display Co. and Japan Display Inc. -- are said to have insufficient capacity to equip all new iPhones this year, a constraint that may persist into 2018. That means Apple may be forced to adopt OLED in just a single version of its device this year, the 10th anniversary of the smartphone\u2019s debut.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for BOE as Apple is known to seek multiple suppliers for one component,\u201d said James Yan, research director for Counterpoint Research in Beijing. \u201cBut it\u2019s unlikely to challenge Samsung because it is able to roll out high-quality screens at a steady capacity.\u201d\nBOE\u2019s shares had climbed 1.3 percent in Shenzhen by midday, outperforming\u00a0a mostly unchanged benchmark A-share index. Universal Display Corp., which licenses and sells technology to makers of OLED screens, rose as much as 9.7 percent, the most since November.\nFounded in 1993 after employees took over an ailing producer of electron tubes, Beijing-based BOE is the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of LCD panels by market value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. BOE, which started out as Beijing Orient and enjoyed the support of a government keen to champion local technology players, is now building a 46.5 billion-yuan flexible AMOLED plant in Chengdu.\u00a0\nWhile it\u2019s ramping up capacity, it\u2019s likely to miss the next iPhone. That sixth-generation factory won\u2019t crank out a single screen till the summer, while new iPhones typically go on sale in the fall.\u00a0When that plant is up to full capacity, it\u2019ll be able to put out 48,000 glass substrates a month, BOE said in an e-mailed statement, referring to the thin surfaces from which screens are carved out.\nAnother plant in Mianyang with the same capacity and investment is expected to start production only about two years later.\u00a0The company currently operates only a small OLED factory in remote Inner Mongolia. Eventually, when its two plants are up and running, it expects to be able to manufacture 1.6 million square-meters of flexible AMOLED glass substrates a year, slightly more than researcher IHS\u2019 estimate for total global production in 2016.\nApple typically introduces new technologies for its iPhones across all models when they\u2019re unveiled, usually in September, as it did with 3D Touch and Apple Pay. Using different core, user-facing technology in the same iPhone generation would be an unusual step. All iPhone 7 models have liquid-crystal display screens.\u00a0\n\u2014 With assistance by Alex Webb, and Yuan Gao\n",

        "content": "The Winners and Losers of a Border-Adjustment Tax\nApple Inc. Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said a U.S. border tax would harm the world\u2019s largest economy by raising costs for consumers and making it harder for companies to compete overseas.\nA border tax also would increase the value of the U.S. dollar, which is already too strong, and reduce the competitiveness of the country\u2019s economy, the CFO said Tuesday at a technology conference in San Francisco sponsored by Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\u00a0\nApple buys most of the components for iPhones, iPads and Mac computers from outside the U.S. and most of its devices are assembled overseas. Trump\u2019s tax talk, and his efforts to increase domestic manufacturing, have raised speculation that Apple may try to make more of its products in the U.S. and get more components domestically.\nMaestri, asked about Apple\u2019s manufacturing process, said the company has contributed greatly to the U.S. economy in the past decade and suggested the global technology supply chain is too big for even Apple to change.\n\u201cThe supply chain for the technology industry is not in the U.S.,\u201d he said.\nStill, Maestri was hopeful for other U.S. tax changes. He said there\u2019s broad support for lowering corporate tax rates in the country and encouraging companies to bring overseas earnings back to the U.S.\nUnder another Trump proposal, companies could pay a one-time 10 percent levy to bring back money held overseas, less than a third of the current rate.\n\u201cThere is a good chance something is going to happen this year,\u201d the CFO said. Apple had more than $230 billion of overseas cash and marketable securities at the end of 2016. Until reform happens, the company will continue with a big capital return program, but if the tax repatriation rate is lowered, it will have more flexibility and could return more cash to shareholders, he said.\n",

The increase valued Apple at about $699 billion, making it the world\u2019s\u00a0most highly capitalized company. Google parent Alphabet Inc. is next at $573 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nAnalysts are predicting a further gain in Apple shares in the next year, based on the average 12-month target price of $142.58, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nThe intraday peak for the shares is $134.54, set in April 2015. The previous closing record was $133 in February of that year. The stock then dropped for more than a year on concern about waning smartphone industry growth and Apple\u2019s prospects beyond the iPhone. However, the company recently\u00a0reported stronger-than-expected iPhone sales during the key holiday quarter, helping the stock reach a new high.\nWhile the iPhone 7, introduced in September, failed to convince as many existing customers to upgrade as its predecessor did, it succeeded in attracting new smartphone buyers to the Cupertino, California-based company. That bodes well for the next iPhone later this year, which is expected to be a more substantial upgrade, according to analysts.\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably just a continuation of the rally following the last quarter report and guidance for the second quarter that\u2019s giving investors a bridge to the next iPhone that many are getting excited about,\u201d said BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk.\nThe stock was also buoyed by the equity market, with all U.S. benchmarks ending the day at records. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which includes Apple, climbed past 20,400 for the first time.\nMore iPhone users increases the chances Apple can sell software, services and subscriptions like Apple Music and iCloud. Services revenue grew 18 percent to $7.2 billion in the most recent period, and the company aims to double the annual total to more than $50 billion by fiscal 2021.\n\u201cA lot of it comes from the fact that our installed base of devices around the world continues to grow very well,\" Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said in a recent interview.\nStill, Apple has struggled to expand into other businesses that are big enough to move the needle at a company with more than $200 billion in annual revenue. Its secretive car project got off to a slow start and the Apple Watch, while popular, hasn\u2019t come close to matching the iPhone\u2019s success. The business can\u2019t rely on hit smartphones alone in the future.\n\"We know what a smartphone looks like and does,\" billionaire technology investor Peter Thiel told the New York Times earlier this year. \"It\u2019s not an area where there will be any more innovation.\"\n",

The request is included in a list of concessions submitted by Apple to a panel of government officials that includes a 15-year tax holiday, the person said.\nApple\u2019s last attempt at such a license was met with resistance as industry executives and government ministries cited risks such a move would open the floodgates to used electronics and undermine the \u2018Make in India\u2019 program to encourage local manufacturing.

        "content": "Apple Beats Estimates With Help From New iPhone Customers\nThe Trump dollar is taking a bite out of the earnings prospects for U.S. companies.\nApple Inc. is boosting the prices of iPhones sold abroad by as much as 40 percent to offset the declining value of foreign sales when they\u2019re converted to dollars. Those higher prices hurt Apple\u2019s ability to compete. Industrial giant Honeywell International Inc. is trimming its sales forecast this year by $600 million and hedging in the currency markets.\nSince\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s surprise win on Nov. 8, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index has gained 2.8 percent on expectations for rising interest rates, even as he told the Wall Street Journal the strong U.S. currency was \u201ckilling us\u201d and criticized China for keeping the yuan artificially low. Before the election, the greenback was already trading near the highest in more than a decade.\n\u201cForeign exchange is a bit of a problem for Apple and any U.S. company that has any business overseas,\u201d Apple Chief Financial Officer\u00a0Luca Maestri said in an interview. \u201cThe dollar is very strong.\u201d\nEarnings for Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 companies are forecast to rise 11.9 percent this year after falling an estimated 0.4 percent in 2016, according to analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That would be the fastest annual earnings growth since 2011. For the 259 companies that have reported fourth-quarter results so far, profit has expanded 5.8 percent from a year earlier and revenue has risen 4.2 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nA stronger dollar may hinder future profit gains, however. Every 10 percent increase in the U.S. currency trims about 3 to 5 percentage points off earnings growth for the S&P 500, said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC.\n\u201cFor those penciling in 10 percent to 12 percent earnings growth, that shaves it quite a bit,\u201d he said. \u201cThat could have some pressure on equity prices.\u201d\nWhile the dollar has weakened about 3 percent since reaching a 14-year high last month, it remains above the average level for 2016. And companies are still feeling the effects of a yearlong, 19 percent surge in the dollar beginning in the summer of 2014. Coupled with a plummet in oil prices, the surging dollar led to declines in S&P 500 earnings that lasted five quarters.\nIf Wall Street is right, companies face more dollar appreciation under Trump. Against the euro, for example, the consensus is for the dollar to strengthen to $1.05 at year-end from about $1.08 now.\nRead more: Why the strong dollar has been an article of faith - a primer\nBill Gross, the billionaire bond investor, says the president\u2019s policies are fueling a powerful dollar and an undervalued Mexican peso, both of which are bad for the U.S. and global economy.\n\u201cI think the dollar is a concern,\u201d Gross, who manages the $1.8 billion Janus Global Unconstrained Bond Fund, said in a Bloomberg TV interview Wednesday. \u201cIt is the global currency. To the extent that the dollar strengthens, not only are U.S. companies affected to the negative, the global marketplace and global countries are affected too.\u201d\nHoneywell, which makes products ranging from jet engines to work boots, has locked in the euro at $1.15 and hedges other currencies to protect its profits. The company had to cut the top range of its 2017 sales forecast to $39.5 billion from $40.1 billion \u201csolely due\u201d to foreign exchange, said CFO Tom Szlosek.\nFor Eaton Corp., which makes parts for heavy trucks, aircraft and earth-moving equipment, the strong dollar has erased $2.5 billion of revenue since 2013 and will likely reduce sales by $300 million this year, Chief Executive Officer Craig Arnold said in an interview.\n\u201cThe U.S. dollar strength has really been a big negative for us in terms of revenue for the company for four years in a row now,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re an exporter, it makes the goods and services that you sell around the world more expensive.\u201d\nA wild card for the dollar is Trump\u2019s plan to overhaul corporate taxes. Republicans have floated the idea of a 20 percent border-adjustment tax on imports as a way to encourage more manufacturing in the U.S. That plan could cause as much as a 25 percent gain for the dollar, according to a report by the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\u00a0\nUnited Technologies Corp.,\u00a0which produces jet engines and elevators, said in December it expects the strong dollar to reduce 2017 sales by $600 million. 3M Co. said currency fluctuations will lower its per-share earnings by 20 cents in 2017 even after factoring in the company\u2019s hedging.\nHarley-Davidson Inc. CEO Matthew Levatich and other company officials met with Trump Thursday in one of the president\u2019s sessions with corporate executives, but it wasn\u2019t clear if the subject of the U.S. currency came up. The biggest factor\u00a0keeping the company\u2019s profit margins from expanding will be the strengthening dollar, CFO John Olin said Jan. 31.\n\u201cWe\u2019re concerned about currency going forward and expect that to be a $20 million to $25 million hit if exchange rates stay\u201d at early 2017 levels, Olin said on a call with analysts.\n",

Terms weren\u2019t disclosed.\nTechren Solar LLC is building the project, NV Energy spokeswoman Jennifer Schuricht said in an e-mail. It\u2019s expected to be complete by early 2019.\nApple has set a goal of getting all of its power worldwide from renewable sources, and has already reached that goal in 23 countries, according to its website. It\u2019s one of a growing number of large companies, especially technology companies including Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google that have arranged deals to buy clean energy from utilities or developers.\n\u201cInvesting in innovative clean energy sources is vital to Apple\u2019s commitment to reaching, and maintaining, 100 percent renewable energy across all our operations, Lisa Jackson, vice president for environment, policy and social initiatives, said in the statement.\n",
