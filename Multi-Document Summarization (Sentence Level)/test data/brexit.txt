        "content": "Prime Minister Theresa May should consider taking Britain back into the European Free Trade Association, the four-country body it left in 1972, in order to jump-start its post-Brexit trade negotiations, a panel of lawmakers said.\nBritain was one of the founders of EFTA in 1960, but left in order to join the body that became the European Union. Now it\u2019s quitting the EU, it could rejoin to take advantage of the 27 free-trade agreements\u00a0that the grouping already has, according to a report by Parliament\u2019s International Trade Committee, which has a majority of Brexit-supporting members from May\u2019s Conservative Party.\nThe suggestion that Britain might rejoin came from EFTA itself, according to James Cleverly, one of the Tories on the committee. The panel was in Geneva talking to the World Trade Organization when officials from EFTA, which includes\u00a0Norway, Switzerland, Iceland and Liechtenstein, asked for a meeting, he said.\n\u201cThe countries in ETFA are more similar to us than the EU,\u201d Cleverly said in an interview. \u201cThey\u2019re outside the euro, they\u2019re internationally focused, they have service-oriented economies, and high GDP per head. It has a whole lot of off-the-shelf trade deals. I was surprisingly impressed.\u201d\nEFTA membership wouldn\u2019t stop Britain seeking further free-trade agreements, according to the committee, but would reduce the pressure. On its own, it would mean agreements with 38 countries that represent 19 percent of British exports. A further five deals, with the EU, the U.S., Japan, China and Australia, would cover 89 percent of British exports.\n",

        "content": "Mervyn King Says House of Lords Must Be Careful on Brexit\nSign up to receive the Brexit Bulletin in your inbox, and follow @Brexit on Twitter.There are multiple warnings about what lies in store for Prime Minister Theresa May as the clock ticks down to the start of Brexit talks.\nHaving already sought the advice of hostage negotiators and divorce lawyers, Bloomberg tapped fresh insights from Greece.\nSeven years of fiscal crisis and bailout talks mean its politicians know just what it\u2019s like to cross swords with the likes of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\nFor former Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis, the lesson for May is \u201cbeware of what I call the euro zone run around.\u201d He predicts British officials will receive conflicting messages from Berlin to Brussels, and that a lot of time will be spent discussing how to structure the negotiations rather than issues such as a free trade deal.\nVaroufakis proposes the U.K. should file Article 50 and then immediately ask to join the European Economic Area, which allows access to the single market in return for free movement of people and some budget contributions. That would give Britain stability and time to assess how to properly engage with the EU, which is \u201creally not interested in a mutually advantageous deal,\u201d he said.\nGeorge Papaconstantinou, who ran Greece\u2019s finance ministry from 2009 to 2011, is more optimistic.\nWhile he anticipates the EU will adopt a \u201cvery hard bargaining\u201d position and seek to safeguard the bloc by refusing to grant too many concessions, he sees Merkel as a political realist.\n\u201cShe does look at the end of the day for decisions which are win-win,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is an element of realism which the U.K. can hope for.\u201d\nMay\u00a0faces a more imminent Brexit setback on Tuesday as lawmakers demand more power to shape the final deal she strikes.\u00a0\nThe House of Lords is set to defeat her in a vote, re-writing her draft law to include a guarantee that Parliament will be able to veto the final Brexit agreement if the deal she makes isn\u2019t deemed good enough. Lawmakers will also have the power to stop May walking away from talks with no deal under an amendment the peers are expected to pass during the bill\u2019s next stage of scrutiny.\nThe amendment to guarantee a \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d is almost certain to pass given some of May\u2019s ruling Conservative Party will align themselves with the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats.\nMay\u2019s team argues that giving legislators the power to veto the final Brexit deal and send the premier back to the negotiating table would undermine her.\u00a0She is likely to ask the House of Commons to delete the Lords\u2019 amendments when the bill returns there on March 13.\nThe government needs to pass the bill for May to start two years of exit talks. ITV\u2019s Robert Peston reported on Monday it may now wait until the end of March to pull the trigger.\nIt&apos;s possible to lose the will to live caring about this stuff, but it now looks as though Article 50 won&apos;t be triggered till end March\nWith the possible exception of finance, no other industry is sweating as much about Brexit as car manufacturing.\nAs Bloomberg View\u2019s Mark Gilbert writes, it\u2019s worried by the prospect of tariffs\u00a0on the 1.3 million cars the U.K. exports each year and on the parts\u00a0that criss-cross between Britain and the EU.\nThe fear business could be walloped if May can\u2019t land a free trade deal may also may explain General Motors\u2019 eagerness to sell its ailing European operation to PSA, the maker of Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn.\nGM President Daniel\u00a0Amman said on Monday that its Opel and Vauxhall operations \u201cwould have been profitable last year except for Brexit.\u201d\nAdopting an upbeat tone, U.K. Business Secretary Greg Clark said the government is committed to keeping the industry competitive.\u00a0PSA Chief Executive Officer Carlos Tavares also said a hard Brexit would present an opportunity for auto producers to source parts in the U.K. Meanwhile, Reuters reported Toyota is fully committed to Britain.\nThe industry lobby group still wants Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond to use Wednesday\u2019s budget to encourage investment and a stronger supply chain, Bloomberg\u2019s John Ainger writes.\nHammond\u2019s budget may serve as a boost for bondholders. Analysts are forecasting gilt issuance in the next fiscal year will be at its lowest since the financial crisis began a decade ago as upgraded economic growth forecasts reduce the need for borrowing.\nThe country\u2019s Debt Management Office will sell \u00a3110 billion ($134 billion) of gilts in the fiscal year 2017/18, compared to \u00a3146.5 billion in the current year, according to the median prediction of 12 primary dealers surveyed by Bloomberg.\nBrexit is proving something of a fantasy for Games Workshop Group, the producer of cult tabletop game Warhammer.\nIts shares have doubled since the referendum and rose anew on Monday after it predicted sales are \u201clikely to be materially above market expectations\u201d\u00a0in part because of the sliding pound.\nThe company, which gets more than half its sales from overseas, sells characters that can be painted and then used to play a dice game, according to Bloomberg\u2019s Joe Easton.\nIn perhaps a parallel with the Brexit negotiations, the \u201cWarhammer:\u00a0Age of Sigmar\u201d rulebook describes battles as \u201cbrutal and uncompromising,\u201d with the losing party left to \u201click their wounds and bear the shame of failure.\u201d\nFor more on Brexit follow Bloomberg on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, and see our full coverage at Bloomberg.com\n",

        "content": "U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s government looks set for an early clash with European Union leaders over the terms of Brexit as a report suggested it can leave the bloc without paying a financial settlement.\nThe Times newspaper on Saturday said government lawyers concluded there is no law or treaty to compel the U.K. to pay the bill EU officials have estimated at about 60 billion euros ($64 billion). That echoed a newly published finding of a House of Lords committee.\nTheresa May\nBalking over a departure bill would risk a rancorous start to negotiations and make it harder for Britain to secure the favorable access to EU markets it still wants to enjoy after Brexit.\nThe Lords report, released Saturday, said Britain and the EU\u2019s 27 other members should nonetheless seek a \u201cfair\u201d divorce because of the \u201cgravity\u201d of failing to reach a deal. A stalemate over the departure bill will make it harder for the government to secure access to EU markets on favorable terms,\u00a0the upper chamber\u2019s EU Financial Affairs Sub-Committee said in the report.\nFor more on Brexit\u2019s costs, click here\n\u201cEven though we consider that the U.K. will not be legally obliged to pay in to the EU budget after Brexit, the issue will be a prominent factor in withdrawal negotiations,\u201d Committee Chairwoman Kishwer Falkner said in a statement. \u201cThe government will have to set the financial and political costs of making such payments against potential gains from other elements of the negotiations.\u201d\nHaggling over how much Britain owes appears set to provide an early test of the formal negotiations, which May has pledged to invoke by the end of March. Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern became the first EU leader to put a value on the bill when he told Bloomberg last month that Britain should be charged about 60 billion euros.\u00a0\nThat sparked anger from May\u2019s Conservative Party, with former leader\u00a0Iain Duncan Smith calling it \u201cnonsense.\u201d Trade Secretary Liam Fox has dismissed the idea of paying anything at all as \u201cabsurd.\u201d\u00a0\nThe Lords report detailed different ways an exit bill could be calculated, with the sum ranging from about 15 billion euros to more than 60 billion euros.\u00a0The amount could include contributions to future commitments made by Britain while still a member of the EU, as well as pension liabilities for those working in EU institutions that could range from 2.5 billion euros to 9.6 billion euros.\nAfter Brexit, the U.K. will cease to pay contributions to the EU that totaled more than 19 billion euros in each of 2013, 2014 and 2015, the panel said. Net contributions averaged about 7.1 billion euros in recent years, once the annual rebate, agricultural funding and grants and subsidies to the public and private sector are taken into account. \u00a0\nIf Britain pays no exit bill, individual EU members may seek to bring a case against the U.K. for payment of outstanding liabilities, \u201cbut international law is slow to litigate and hard to enforce,\u201d the panel said.\n\u201cThe forthcoming negotiations will be more than just a trial of strength,\u201d\u00a0Falkner said. \u201cThey will be about establishing a stable, cooperative and amicable relationship between the U.K. and the EU. This will not be possible without good will on both sides.\u201d\n",

        "content": "When U.K. Brexit Secretary David Davis told his cabinet colleagues last week that they should brace for \"the unlikely scenario in which no mutually satisfactory agreement\" is reached on Brexit, it set off alarm bells in one industry in particular -- and it&apos;s not the finance industry.\nBritain&apos;s automotive industry employs 169,000 workers directly in manufacturing and a total of more than 800,000 workers across the sector, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), an industry lobbying group. The prospect of tariffs both on the 1.3 million cars the U.K. exports each year and on the parts that cross back and forth between the U.K. and the EU is putting those jobs at risk.\nQuickTake How Post-Brexit Trade Might Work\nNissan Motor Co. estimates it could lose as much as 600 million pounds ($738 million) in profit on the 320,000 Qashqai SUVs it makes annually in Sunderland, Senior Vice President Colin Lawther told lawmakers on Wednesday. That&apos;s based on an estimated 10 percent tariff on exports to the EU, plus duties of as much as 4.5 percent on imported parts.\nSwati Dhingra, an economics lecturer at the London School of Economics, estimated in a study prior to last year&apos;s referendum that Brexit could reduce total U.K. car production by as much as 12 percent.\nExports from the U.K. auto industry are worth more than 34 billion pounds, accounting for 12 percent of the country&apos;s total exports of goods based on the most recent figures for 2015, according to the SMMT. While those goods are sold to more than 100 countries, the EU is by far the most important market, with a share of 57.5 percent dwarfing about 11 percent to the U.S. and 7 percent to China:\u00a0\nCarmakers are trying to insulate themselves from the effects of leaving the EU. McLaren Automotive Ltd., for example, is building a Sheffield factory to move chassis production out of Austria. The move, already planned prior to the June referendum, reduces the risk that the maker of models including the $1.4 million P1 supercar will face tariffs on parts imported from Europe, which currently comprise about half of the cost of a car. Jaguar Land Rover, part of India&apos;s Tata Motors Ltd., is also sourcing more parts from the U.K.\nNissan, which employs more than 7,000 workers directly at its Sunderland factory with a further 28,000 jobs at suppliers dependent on the Japanese company, is so far the only automaker to have secured a post-Brexit commitment from the government. The support came in the form of a secret October letter from Secretary of State for Business Greg Clark, who later revealed that he&apos;d made four key pledges, including seeking to maintain tariff-free access to the EU for the car industry. No wonder Nissan has reserved the right to revisit its investment decisions once the U.K. concludes its exit negotiations.\nAvoiding tariffs seems incompatible with the government&apos;s willingness to abandon the EU&apos;s customs union. Confederation of British Industry president Paul Drechslerwill warned in a speech on Thursday that leaving the EU without a trade deal would inflict World Trade Organization tariffs on 90 percent of the goods British companies export, opening a \"Pandora\u2019s Box of economic consequences.\"\nIn response to Nissan&apos;s comments last week, Prime Minister Theresa May&apos;s spokesman Greg Swift said the government will seek \"a deal that allows there to be an environment for Nissan and other companies in the automotive sector to flourish.\" May is on the record as saying that \"no deal for Britain is better than a bad deal.\" The auto industry suggests any deal that minimizes the future cost of doing business with the EU is better than no deal at all.\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\nTo contact the author of this story:          Mark Gilbert      at magilbert@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story:          Therese Raphael     at traphael4@bloomberg.net\n",

Writing in the Sunday Times, he said a spending spree financed by borrowing would be \"reckless,\" as the newspaper reported the chancellor will set aside a 60-billion-pound ($74 billion) fund to offset any setbacks during two years of Brexit negotiations with the European Union -- a figure Hammond told a broadcaster interviewer he didn\u2019t recognize.\nPhilip Hammond\n\u201cMy job as chancellor is making sure our economy is resilient\" so that \"as we embark on the journey we\u2019ll be taking over the next couple of years confident that we have enough gas in the tank to see us through,\u201d Hammond said on the BBC\u2019s \u201cAndrew Marr Show\u201d on Sunday. \u201cAny chancellor would be sensible to try to make sure that he has enough flexibility to manage the economy.\u201d\nMay has set a deadline to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, formally starting Brexit talks, by the end of the month. While the economy has so far been resilient since the vote, higher inflation, slow wage growth and planned benefit cuts have led organizations such as the Institute for Fiscal Studies to warn inequality and poverty in Britain will worsen. In addition, Hammond has come under pressure over funding shortages in the National Health Service and social care.\nThe potential cost of Brexit also caused speculation after Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern told Bloomberg Britain\u2019s liabilities to the EU could total 60 billion pounds. A House of Lords report on Saturday suggested the government may not be under any obligation to pay -- an assertion Hammond seemed to reject.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are a country that very much abides by the rule of law. We meet our international obligations,\u201d Hammond told ITV\u2019s \u201cPeston on Sunday\u201d show. \u201cIf there are any outstanding dues that we are obliged to pay then of course we\u2019ll pay them\" though he dismissed the specific numbers as \u201cpositioning before negotiations.\u201d\nHammond reiterated May\u2019s stance that leaving the EU with no deal was better than a bad deal. He told the BBC the \u201cthe economy is performing extremely well, much better than many people projected\u201d which \u201cgives the prime minister a very strong hand as she goes into negotiations.\u201d\n\u201cThe alternative is not Britain just slinking away into a corner,\u201d he said on the BBC. \u201cWe will fight back and forge new trade deals around the world.\u201d\nNevertheless, Hammond suggested the \u201cmood music\u201d from Europe made him confident an accord would be reached.\nBrexit \u201cis increasingly being seen as a shared problem,\u201d Hammond said on ITV. \u201c feel confident we are moving closer together not further apart.\u201d\nHammond, in his op-ed in the Sunday Times, said his budget would focus on three key points: supporting May in her Brexit negotiations by maintaining the economy\u2019s resilience, getting Britain \u201cmatch fit\u201d for the exit by targeted investment, and helping ordinary working families.\n",

Lawmakers would also be able to stop May walking away from talks with no deal under the amendment, which the unelected upper house is expected to pass during its scrutiny of the bill.\nRead about why Brexit\u2019s detour through Parliament is important.\n\u201cI have said all along that we would not block Brexit, while reserving our right to challenge and scrutinize any legislation put before us,\u201d said Angela Smith, the opposition Labour Party\u2019s leader in the Lords. May\u2019s government could face new court challenges if Parliament is not \u201cproperly engaged in the process\u201d of shaping the Brexit deal, she said.\nMay is vulnerable to a defeat in the Lords because the 252 Conservative members are outnumbered by Labour, Liberal Democrat and independent, or \u201ccrossbench,\u201d peers.\u00a0She overcame a first hurdle shortly before 1:30 p.m., when peers rejected a Liberal Democrat proposal for a referendum on the eventual Brexit agreement.\nIn response to that vote, Liberal Democrat Leader Tim Farron told reporters his party will vote against invoking Article 50 of the EU\u2019s Lisbon Treaty, the official trigger for Brexit talks. The party issued a statement saying it has proposed a new amendment to deny the bill passage to the next legislative stage in the House of Lords.\nOther amendments up for discussion include one calling for the government to provide quarterly updates to Parliament on the Brexit negotiations, another seeking to guarantee the rights of people in Northern Ireland to claim Irish citizenship, and two seeking Parliamentary votes on the final Brexit deal. Peers last week defeated May with another amendment on the rights of EU citizens.\nThe amendment to guarantee a meaningful vote is almost certain to win support in spite of the government\u2019s opposition.

May is likely to ask the lower house to delete the Lords\u2019 amendments when the bill returns there March 13. Her spokesman, James Slack, told reporters on Tuesday that the premier is \u201cabsolutely\u201d on course to officially trigger Brexit negotiations by the end of March.\nThe government says the amendment would give European leaders a strong reason to offer Britain the worst possible agreement in order to try to stop the country leaving.\n\u201cParliament has to respect the will of the British people,\u201d Slack said on Monday. \u201cWe should not commit to any process that would give the EU an incentive to offer us a bad deal.\u201d\nMinisters have already promised to give Parliament a vote on whether to accept the final Brexit deal, but Slack confirmed that this would be no more than \u201ca vote on whether we accept the deal or leave without the deal.\u201d\n",
