        "content": "Facebook's Aquila drone\nWhile Google shuttered its\u00a0Titan drone project, Facebook Inc. is planning to ramp up test flights for its own experimental solar-powered glider.\nFacebook will begin launching a couple of flights a month of its Aquila drone, Jay Parikh, head of engineering and infrastructure, said in an interview Monday at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.\n\u201cWe learned a lot, from data, to how it turned, how it handled, and the battery performance,\u201d Parikh said. \u201cThe systems performed way better that planned. But we need to fly a lot more and more regularly.\u201d\nThe high-altitude drone, which has a wingspan wider than a Boeing 737 and is powered by four electric engines, had its first test flight in June last year. However, a report by the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board in November said the drone suffered a \u201cstructural failure\u201d as it was coming in for landing.\nAquila\u2019s giant flying wing is solar powered, designed so it can remain aloft for long stretches.\u00a0\nFacebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has been busy devising new ways to connect as much of the world\u2019s population to the internet, which includes leapfrogging ground-based infrastructure limitations and instead beaming connectivity from the sky.\nGoogle parent Alphabet Inc.\u2019s research lab said January it had shut down Titan in early 2016. Google beat Facebook in bidding for Titan Aerospace in 2014, leading Facebook to purchase U.K.-based Aquila, which was already building solar powered airplanes. Project Loon, another Google project to beam internet from high-altitude balloons, is still going.\nAqulia is still in its early stages, said Parikh. While much of the aerospace design is done in a farm in a rural part of Southwest England, the software is developed in Menlo Park, California, and the testing will remain in Arizona. Parikh said that Facebook is also evaluating other test sites.\n",

        "content": "The legal battle that&apos;s starting between Waymo, the self-driving car spin-off of Google&apos;s former \"moonshot\" unit, and ride-hailing giant Uber appears to be all about trade secrets and patents. But there is a bigger issue behind it: Silicon Valley ethics and employee loyalty.\u00a0\nThe Waymo lawsuit contends that a former employee, Anthony Levandowski, downloaded 9.7 gigabytes of sensitive data about the company&apos;s proprietary self-driving system, in particular its main element -- the LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) system, which scans the car&apos;s environment with lasers and feeds information to software that makes driving decisions. He then left Google\u00a0-- after drawing\u00a0his multimillion-dollar bonus\u00a0--\u00a0and set up his own company, Otto. Within months, he sold it to Uber for $680 million, enabling Uber to catch up immediately on years of research and development.\nIn dismissing a similar claim in court -- allegations that its Oculus\u00a0Rift, the virtual reality device, was based on stolen technology -- Facebook chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg said\u00a0companies often \"come out of the woodwork\" to scavenge pieces of high-profile tech acquisitions. But that can&apos;t be said about Waymo\u00a0in the self-driving car case.\u00a0\nGoogle is an Uber investor, and it would have been unlikely to sue one of its portfolio companies without thinking things through. The lawsuit appears to be based on a thorough internal investigation, and Uber says it&apos;s taking the allegations seriously.\u00a0\nBut even if Google is technically right, it likely brought on its problem itself. So do other Silicon Valley giants.\nTalentful, the tech recruitment company, recently analyzed LinkedIn data for the employees of 15 top U.S. tech firms, including Google, Uber, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft.\u00a0Among them, Google emerged as the most prodigious poacher, hiring a total of 12,798 employees from the other firms. And that doesn&apos;t even include talent acquired with the startup companies they worked for.\nIn the Waymo lawsuit, Google describes its self-driving car project\u00a0as something that was built from scratch in-house. Levandowski, however, worked on autonomous vehicles long before he came to Google and before it was even interested in the industry. In 2001, he founded a startup called 510 systems. In 2004, using technology he had developed, Levandowski made a self-driving motorcycle for a race sponsored by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. In 2011,\u00a0as a Google employee working on Street View -- the map feature that shows real-life views of streets and buildings -- he\u00a0persuaded Google to buy 510 systems in a deal that was never publicly announced. In fact, the startup&apos;s employees had signed agreements not to discuss the acquisition. The little company became the foundation of the search giant&apos;s foray into mobility tech.\nThe incentive system Google set up for employees on the autonomous car team tied their income to certain undisclosed project milestones. It ended up being so generous that, as Bloomberg recently reported, Waymo became a sizable drag on the finances of the parent company, Alphabet. Employees were getting such big payouts that they no longer need the jobs, and they began leaving: With their newfound financial independence, there was no need for them to tolerate big-company bureaucracy.\u00a0\nThe Silicon Valley ethos is not about rules and organizational structures. Outstanding engineers who generate breakthrough innovations are only guests at the big corporations, seduced into keeping still for a few years with lavish payments and nice working conditions. They don&apos;t, however, develop a loyalty toward the sources of these goodies. Their primary goal is often to advance their technological ideas -- something that is hard to square with big company culture, even if the company is Google, with its deep insight into the techie psyche.\nSo how does one keep talent from migrating away and valuable innovations leaking to competitors? One way is to become more litigious. A\u00a02014 paper by Martin Gango\u00a0of the University of Minnesota and two collaborators shows that the more a tech employer is inclined to defend its intellectual property in court, the less likely employees working on high-value projects are to go to the competition. \"By establishing reputations for intellectual property enforcement, managers can retain key knowledge workers,\" the researchers wrote.\nGoogle appears to be doing just that with the Waymo vs. Uber case. Though such litigation is expensive and outcomes are far from assured, few engineers want to find themselves on the receiving end of big corporation fury. But there&apos;s a flip side: If Google establishes a reputation for going after former employees, it will have a harder time attracting major talent and buying further promising startups.\u00a0If it wants to grow more of its talent in-house, that&apos;s a trade-off worth making. But if poaching continues to be the preferred mode of operation, the litigiousness may cost Google more than one future breakthrough.\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\nTo contact the author of this story:          Leonid Bershidsky     at lbershidsky@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story:          Mike Nizza     at mnizza3@bloomberg.net\n",

        "content": "Five months after introducing\u00a0its digital assistant, Google is sharing the feature with Android partners, hoping the service can boost its odds to win customers from Apple Inc.&apos;s iPhone.\u00a0\nAlphabet Inc.&apos;s Google is making its intelligent assistant -- a\u00a0service that answers queries, plays music and completes tasks --\u00a0available for smartphones using the two newest versions of its\u00a0Android software. It&apos;s showcasing the service with a closer partnership with LG Electronics Co. announced Sunday at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, where LG and a slew of hardware manufacturers aim to make a splash ahead of the iPhone&apos;s 10th anniversary later this year.\u00a0\nGoogle&apos;s assistant on LG&apos;s new G6 phone introduced Sunday at the Mobile World Congress.\nUntil now, Google&apos;s Pixel smartphone, introduced in October, has been the only handset with the company&apos;s automated assistant.\u00a0Gummi Hafsteinsson, the product lead for the assistant, said exclusivity was required to refine the system, a key priority at the company. \"It was a new product and we wanted to make sure we took the baby steps required,\" he said.\u00a0Investment bank\u00a0Evercore ISI estimates that Mountain View, California-based Google shipped 552,000 Pixel phones in the fourth quarter last year in addition to 500,000 Google Home speakers, another device that already runs the assistant service, making the current accessibility to Google Assistant slim compared with competitors like Apple&apos;s Siri and Amazon.com Inc.&apos;s Alexa.\u00a0\nBy adding the assistant to Android devices, which researcher IDC estimates make up 85 percent of all global smartphones, Google is moving closer to its goal of expanding the use of the feature. The virtual assistant will reach about one-third of Android phones, including the new devices rolled out Sunday by LG and others, that use Google&apos;s latest software, according to the company.\u00a0\n\u00a0\"We obviously would want to provide it to every device in the world,\" Hafsteinsson\u00a0added.\nAndroid phones that run Google&apos;s Play store services will now have access to the assistant, which can be summoned through a voice command (\"OK, Google\") or the phone&apos;s home screen. But Google is working more intimately with LG.\u00a0\nOn Sunday in Barcelona, LG unveiled its latest phone, the G6, with the Google Assistant. It has super slim bezels on either side of the 5.7-inch display, putting a larger screen than that of the iPhone 7 Plus into a smaller package. The phone from the South Korean company has a dual-lens camera system and a high-resolution screen packed into a thin metal body. Those features put it on par with the latest pricier smartphones -- a competitive field that includes rising Chinese players, such as Huawei Technologies Co., and now Google.\u00a0\nLG worked closely with the Pixel maker to ensure that the South Korean company&apos;s own services, like its calendar and alarm clock apps, work easily with Google&apos;s assistant. Some of its Android peers, such as Samsung, are building their own voice-assistant services. Bloomberg News reported that Huawei is doing the same.\u00a0\n\"We still keep a very close relationship between LG and Google, even though Google is building their own phone,\" said Ian Hwang, a product manager at LG. He called Google a \"frenemy,\"\u00a0but said the search giant cannot rely on its own Pixel phone\u00a0as the world&apos;s only advanced Android hardware.LG had 3.7 percent of the global smartphone market as of the end of the 2016 third quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\u00a0The phones are going on sale ahead of an expected significant half of the year for the smartphone industry. Samsung Electronics Co. is prepping the latest release of its flagship Galaxy S line. Apple is getting ready for a new iPhone with a crisper OLED display and an embedded Home button with a glass back. Andy Rubin, the creator of Google&apos;s Android software, is working on his own smartphone hardware. With each device, the creators are focusing increasingly on artificial intelligence software to lock consumers into the companies&apos; systems.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n",

        "content": "Line Corp. outlined an ambitious artificial-intelligence strategy that promises to transform Japan\u2019s most popular messaging service while pitting it against Google, Facebook Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.\nThe company is launching a suite of AI software tools to power an online digital assistant capable of conversing in Japanese and Korean, Line said at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona on Wednesday.\u00a0Users can talk to the assistant, getting the latest weather and news through either a dedicated smartphone app or a tabletop-speaker called Wave that\u2019s similar to Amazon\u2019s Echo. Both will be available in early summer.\nClova&apos;s smart speaker WAVE.\nSilicon Valley companies are exploring ways of extending their reach beyond smartphones, with Amazon and Google both selling AI-powered digital assistants not unlike Wave. Facebook, whose Messenger and WhatsApp compete with Line, has\u00a0launched a chatbot platform and plowed more than $2 billion into virtual reality. But Line believes it can leverage local knowledge to beat tech giants in its home country and markets where its messaging service is popular, including South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Indonesia.\n\u201cThere is a shift toward toward post-smartphone, post-touch technologies,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Takeshi Idezawa said in an interview. \u201cThese connected devices will permeate even deeper into our daily lives and therefore must even closer match the local needs, languages and cultures.\u201d\nLine developed its AI platform with parent Naver Corp. The South Korean company operates that country\u2019s dominant search engine, displacing Google in a testament to the power of local knowledge, Idezawa said.\nTokyo-based Line is already much more than a messaging service on its home turf, with people using the app to read news, hail taxis and find part-time jobs. That wealth of content and interaction in local languages gives Line an advantage over larger rivals because AI is only as good as the data on which it\u2019s trained, Idezawa said.\nLine is also open to acquisitions and partnerships in the field. The company is buying a stake in Vinclu, a Tokyo-based\u00a0Internet of Things startup. It invested in\u00a0Sound Hound, a\u00a0U.S.-based voice recognition company,\u00a0together with Naver\u00a0last month. And it\u2019s considering joining forces with Sony Corp. to develop smart devices.\nLine\u2019s shares rose as much as 2.1 percent in Tokyo on Thursday. The stock is still down about 2 percent\u00a0this year, amid concerns about stagnating growth at a company that pulled off 2016\u2019s biggest technology public offering. Idezawa is under pressure to find new sources of revenue on what is otherwise a free messaging service, as subscriber addition and revenue from games and digital stickers slow.\nFor now, Line has pinned its hopes on advertising and as-yet unannounced products, while AI remains a more distant prospect.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the longer-term bets,\u201d Idezawa said. \u201cThe point is to secure a position early on. People will probably begin to use these services more regularly three to five years from now.\u201d\n",

        "content": "What's Fueling the Talent Drain at Google's Car Project?\nFor the past year, Google&apos;s car project has been a talent sieve, thanks to leadership changes, strategy doubts, new startup dreams and rivals luring self-driving technology experts. Another force pushing people out? Money. A lot of it.\u00a0\nEarly staffers had an unusual compensation system that awarded supersized payouts based on the project&apos;s value. By late 2015, the numbers were so big that several veteran members\u00a0didn&apos;t need the job security anymore, making them more open to other opportunities, according to people familiar with the situation. Two people called it \"F-you money.\"\nIn December, the car unit morphed into a standalone business called Waymo, and the system was replaced with a more uniform pay structure that treats all employees the same, according to a person familiar with the situation. Still, the original program got so costly that a top executive at parent Alphabet Inc. highlighted it last year to explain a jump in expenses. A spokeswoman for\u00a0Alphabet, the holding company that owns Google and \"Other Bets\" like the autonomous car business, declined to comment.\u00a0\nThe payouts contributed to a talent exodus at a time when the company\u00a0was trying to turn the project into a real business and emerging rivals were recruiting heavily. The episode highlights Alphabet&apos;s difficult transition from a digital advertising giant into a diversified technology company with varied groups of employees requiring different incentives. Other new businesses, including health care unit Verily, use different compensation systems too, but they have yet to generate huge payouts like the car project.\nThe unorthodox system started in 2010, soon after Google unveiled its first self-driving vehicle. It was constructed to tie employees&apos; fortunes to the performance of the project, rather than Google&apos;s advertising money machine. In addition to cash salaries, some staffers were given bonuses and equity in the business and these awards were set aside in a special entity. After several years, Google applied a multiplier to the value of the awards and paid some or all of it out. The multiplier was based on periodic valuations of the division, the people said.\u00a0\nThe precise metrics that the division was measured by-- and caused the bonuses to balloon-- are not known. But by 2015, the Google car project had come a long way: Google\u2019s vehicles had logged more than one million autonomous miles; car companies including Toyota Motor Corp. and Tesla Inc. announced their own plans to develop autonomous systems; and analysts\u00a0predicted\u00a0the technology would transform the auto industry.\nA large\u00a0multiplier was applied to the compensation\u00a0packages in late 2015, resulting in multi-million dollar payments in some cases, according to the people familiar with the situation. One member of the team had a multiplier of 16 applied to bonuses and equity amassed\u00a0over four years, one of the people said. They asked not to be identified talking about private matters.\u00a0Part of the problem was that payouts snowballed after key\u00a0milestones were reached, even though\u00a0the ultimate goal of the project -- fully autonomous vehicles provided to the public through commercial services -- remained years away.\u00a0\nRuth Porat\nIt\u2019s unclear how much the payouts cost Alphabet, however, Chief Financial Officer\u00a0Ruth Porat\u00a0talked about it during an earnings conference call with analysts in early 2016.\nOperating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2015 rose 14 percent to $6.6 billion, \"primarily driven by R&D expense, particularly affected by expenses resulting from project milestones in Other Bets established several years ago,\" Porat said, according to a transcript. The CFO wasn\u2019t specific, but one of the people familiar with the situation said the comments referred to the car project compensation.\nChris Urmson, previous leader of the project, departed in August and is\u00a0working on a startup. Other early project members left to form Otto, a self-driving trucking company that was quickly snapped up by Uber Technologies Inc. Bryan Salesky, a former Google car executive, started Argo AI, which got a $1 billion investment from Ford Motor Co. on Friday. \u00a0\nUrmson and Salesky didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\u00a0Sebastian Thrun, who started the car project and helped design the pay system, didn\u2019t respond to questions, either.\nDuring the early 2016 conference call, Porat suggested a different approach to incentives at Other Bets in the future. \"It is about getting more ambitious things done. We\u2019re doing that in a framework to ensure we are disciplined with our resources, and this was just calling out a milestone established some time ago,\" she said.\n",

        "content": "What\u2019s the Key Catalyst for Google\u2019s Growth?\nIn December, Felix Kjellberg threatened to take his star power off YouTube.\nTurns out, it was a ruse. The Swede behind the PewDiePie character admitted in a video that he was trying to boost his YouTube fan numbers to more than 50 million. Irreverence like this has turned him into the biggest celebrity on YouTube and helped the Google site become the world\u2019s largest online video service.\nUntil, late on Monday, it became a liability. Google said it was removing PewDiePie\u2019s channel from its premium advertising service and canceling his YouTube series after he published videos with anti-Semitic messages.\nThe controversy is a setback for YouTube\u2019s strategy of promoting premium content that attracts top advertising rates, and its newer attempt to get viewers to pay for original TV shows and movies. Kjellberg\u2019s series \"Scare PewDiePie\" was one of the shows on this subscription service, known as YouTube Red.\nYouTube\u2019s programming strategy is devoted to the young, aspiring filmmakers, video bloggers and sketch comedians that first used the site. Unlike Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., which have spent billions of dollars on programming from professionals already working in the Hollywood system, YouTube has funded original shows from PewDiePie, Joey Graceffa and Rhett & Link.\nThese stars help YouTube stand out from the crowd, but are harder to control. They built large followings speaking their minds without the filter of a producer or the restraints of a traditional media company.\nThe antics of YouTube stars are subject to greater scrutiny since large media companies gobbled up many of YouTube\u2019s biggest channels. PewDiePie\u2019s freewheeling style didn\u2019t sit well at Walt Disney Co., whose Maker Studios cut ties with Kjellberg earlier on Monday in response to the videos. The Wall Street Journal first reported on Disney\u2019s move.\nYouTube determined that some of Kjellberg\u2019s videos, which included one where he paid for two men to unfurl a sign reading \"Death to All Jews,\" violated its standards for advertiser-friendly content. However, YouTube decided that the videos didn\u2019t cross its threshold for hate speech, which specifies that content must be intended to incite violence.\nSo the company dropped Kjellberg from Google Preferred, its white-glove service for brand-safe ads, and canceled the second season of his show for YouTube Red. It didn\u2019t remove Kjellberg\u2019s videos from its site, nor restrict him from the regular system that drives most YouTube ads. A YouTube spokeswoman declined to comment further on the decision.\nFor Google, the public rebuke of YouTube\u2019s biggest star won\u2019t materially affect advertising sales. YouTube sells most of its ad in bulk, not around particular channels. And PewDiePie, though popular, accounts for a tiny fraction of overall viewership on a video site where thousands of channels have millions of subscribers.\n\"It\u2019s one creator,\" said Richard Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG LLC. \"YouTube is far, far stronger than any one creator.\"\nStill, the move may put other YouTube creators on notice.\u00a0\nWhile removing the offending videos from premium ad deals was warranted, YouTube may risk pushing away creators if its standards look too stringent, said Jill Sherman, senior vice president at advertising agency DigitasLBi. \"The second it feels policed or overly mandated, it starts to feel like prime-time television,\" she said. \"And that\u2019s exactly what YouTube doesn\u2019t want.\"\nGoogle doesn\u2019t disclose YouTube revenue, but has said repeatedly that it is, along with mobile ads, a primary driver of growth. During the fourth quarter, Ruth Porat, Chief Financial Officer of Google parent Alphabet Inc., said YouTube was seeing \"tremendous growth.\"\u00a0\nShe wouldn\u2019t share how many paid subscribers YouTube Red has. \"We\u2019re pleased with the early success,\" Porat said. \"It\u2019s still early days. It takes a while to build a subscription business here.\"\n",

Donald Trump.At least, that&apos;s what it&apos;s mainly been so far, with the president&apos;s obstreperous tweets, strange phone calls with foreign leaders and other actions generating attention of a sort perhaps never before seen for a U.S. president. It&apos;s hard to say that with confidence, of course -- how would you measure it? But thanks to Google Trends, we can at least compare Trump\u00a0with his predecessor, whose election was also, if you remember, kind of a big deal.\nHere&apos;s Google search interest in Trump over the past year-plus versus interest in the nation that he now leads: \nDonald Trump is bigger than the United States! At least, he was the week he was elected and for a couple of weeks around inauguration. Then again, that&apos;s not unprecedented. Here&apos;s the same chart for the equivalent period in Barack Obama&apos;s career:\nGoogle Trends doesn&apos;t give data on absolute search volume, just search interest relative to the term for which interest was highest, on the week that it was highest. Search interest about\u00a0the U.S., then, provides something of a baseline with which to compare the two presidents.In both charts, peak interest was\u00a0in the president-elect during the week of the election, and in both cases the ratio of search interest\u00a0in the president-elect versus search interest in the country was about 1.5 to 1. On the other big peak, inauguration week, Obama outperformed Trump relative to the baseline. For just about every other week, though,\u00a0search interest in Trump\u00a0remained much closer to the U.S.\u00a0baseline than search interest in Obama did. His ratings have been much better, in other words.\nRatings are clearly very important to Trump, and\u00a0steering attention toward himself was key to his success in the Republican primaries. Here&apos;s the search-interest chart for Trump and four of his Republican rivals during the first six months of last year:\nIn the general election, Trump&apos;s\u00a0search-interest lead over Hillary Clinton\u00a0-- which he relinquished only during the week when she collapsed at a Sept. 11 commemoration\u00a0--\u00a0brought more mixed results. He lost the popular vote by a substantial margin but turned out motivated voters in the states that counted.Lately, the disadvantages of being\u00a0the focus of everybody&apos;s attention have become more\u00a0apparent. Trump&apos;s policies and appointments actually\u00a0aren&apos;t all that\u00a0unpopular. But\u00a0the man&apos;s antics seem to be\u00a0convincing more and more Americans that\u00a0he&apos;s unfit for office.Still, as Derek Thompson put it in a smart New York Times dissection of\u00a0Trump&apos;s approach to media domination, he \"has had dreadful weeks before -- and here we are.\" Trump may not be adept\u00a0at many of the things that successful politicians tend to be\u00a0adept at, but he&apos;s awfully good at keeping our attention.",

        "content": "Vattenfall wind turbines in Aggersund, Denmark.\nThe quest to supply everything from data server halls, insurance companies to large furniture stores with green electricity has flooded the Nordic region with wind power and crashed a $100 million renewable-certificates market.\nWhile that\u2019s good for the environment and the image of companies from Google Inc. to Ikea Group,\u00a0the growth in renewable energy has been faster than Sweden and Norway expected. That\u2019s pushed certificate prices down 45 percent this year, undermining the incentive to invest in new wind power projects.\nRenewable Certificates Prices at Broker SKM\nIt\u2019s a case of too much, too soon for\u00a0the Swedish Energy Agency, the market regulator, which never really planned for expansion at this rate. Taking into account a typical wind turbine\u2019s life of about 20 years, its preference was always for a major build-out by the end of next decade, just before state-owned utility Vattenfall AB starts to close six\u00a01980s-era nuclear reactors.\nWith renewable capacity needed to meet a 2020 target either already in place or under construction, every additional investment will just add to a surplus, according to Nena AS, an industry consultant in Oslo.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like watching a python dying from starvation after devouring a pig that is too large for it to digest,\u201d said Fredrik Bodecker, chairman of Bodecker Partners AB, an energy markets adviser in Malmo, Sweden.\nSweden and Norway plan to add 28.4 terawatt-hours of renewable generation by 2020, or enough to meet 10 percent of their joint annual power demand. In the renewable-certificates market, green energy producers receive securities that suppliers must buy to match customer demand. The surge in capacity hasn\u2019t been met by increases in consumption, hence the surplus and plunging prices.\nGoogle, which operates a data server hall in Finland, has signed at least six deals in the past two years to buy power at a fixed price directly from wind parks in Sweden and Norway. The company didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\u201cThere is just such an insane amount of wind power projects that should not really be built,\u201d said Joachim Jernas, a senior analyst at Nena. \u201cDuring 2016, decisions to build 7.1 terawatt-hours of wind power in Norway and Sweden were made.\u201d\nAfter spending an undisclosed sum on 46 wind-power plants in Sweden between 2011 and 2015, Ikea now generates enough to supply its 20 department stores with green electricity. There are no plans for further expansion in the Nordic region, according to Jonas Carlehed, a sustainability manager at the retailer.\nTo slow down wind power development after 2020, the Swedish Energy Agency proposes to keep subsidy levels low until the end of the next decade by adjusting demand in the system, said Roger Ostberg, an analyst at the regulator. Such a plan could discourage investors seeking stable, long-term returns, according to Paul Stormoen, the managing director of OX2\u2019s wind power development.\n\u201dIt is not just something you can switch off and on, there is a long process behind every investment\u201d Stormoen said.\n",

        "content": "A Philadelphia court has made the unfortunate decision to\u00a0reopen\u00a0the legal debate on whether the U.S. has the right to access e-mails stored on foreign servers if they belong to U.S. companies. If Magistrate Thomas Rueter&apos;s ruling stands, anyone using U.S.-based internet companies will have to live with the knowledge that, as far as the U.S. government is concerned, it&apos;s America wherever they operate.\nThat&apos;s a dangerous approach that hurts\u00a0the international expansion of U.S. tech companies. Privacy-minded customers in Europe are already suspicious of the U.S. government&apos;s cooperation with the tech giants, revealed by National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden. Nationalist politicians in some countries -- for example, Marine Le Pen of the French National Front -- want to ban cross-border personal data transfers, arguing that such data must be stored on servers inside the internet user&apos;s country. That, however, does not appear to guarantee that the U.S. won&apos;t get at it, either.\nLast July, Microsoft won a landmark case against the U.S. government, in which it argued it didn&apos;t have to hand over e-mails stored on a server in Dublin to investigators working on a drug case. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit agreed with the corporation, ruling that the U.S. Congress never meant the Stored Communications Act to apply extraterritorially. Just two weeks ago, the court allowed the ruling to stand. The government may yet appeal it to the Supreme Court, but in the meantime, U.S. internet companies have assumed that if communications are stored abroad, they are out of the U.S. authorities&apos; reach.\u00a0\nActing on that understanding, Google refused to\u00a0disclose two users&apos; data\u00a0to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the FBI went to court in Philadelphia. Unlike Microsoft, Google doesn&apos;t even know the physical location of a file: its artificial intelligence-based system constantly optimizes storage,\u00a0so bits of one file\u00a0can be stored in several geographic locations at once.\u00a0\nJudge Rueter refused to be bound by the Microsoft precedent.\u00a0In his ruling, he disagreed with it, arguing that as long as an American Google employee gets the data using a computer located in the U.S., nothing extraterritorial is taking place: \"When Google produces the electronic data in accordance with the search warrants and the Government views it, the actual invasion of the account holders&apos; privacy -- the searches -- will occur in the United States.\"\nWithin that logic, any information, public or private, that the U.S. government can locate using computers on U.S. territory is fair game. And if the logic applies, the European Union\u00a0wasted its time last year as it tried to establish an acceptable privacy standard for U.S. companies operating in Europe.\nA new framework for these companies became necessary after the European Court of Justice struck down the EU&apos;s so-called safe harbor agreement with the U.S., which allowed internet companies to shuttle personal data back and forth between the two jurisdictions based on an understanding that the U.S. provided adequate protection for users&apos; privacy. The so-called Privacy Shield, which replaced the \"safe harbor\" arrangement, is still pretty permissive, allowing companies to self-certify their commitment to user privacy, but it simplifies redress and gives European data privacy authorities more power over cross-border communication. If, however, the U.S. decides that it can just take the data from foreign servers, the new agreement will be rendered meaningless.\nFor U.S. companies, this will mean a need to invent new private arrangements to protect European customers, the kind Microsoft proposed in 2015. It appointed Deutsche Telekom \"data trustee\" for two data centers in Germany, making it impossible for anyone, including Microsoft itself, to obtain any information from the servers without the permission of the trustee and, ultimately, the client. Such tricks, however, may not stand up in U.S. courts, if other judges agree with Rueter.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court will probably have to take a stand on the issue: Google has already decided to appeal Rueter&apos;s ruling, and now that there are conflicting precedents, the government, too, will definitely want to pursue the battle to the bitter end.\nWaiting for a decision, millions of foreigners\u00a0must decide\u00a0whether to cut their losses in this front of the\u00a0online privacy wars: It\u00a0may no longer be OK to expose their lives\u00a0to U.S. corporations.\nThose who are uneasy\u00a0about the degree of the U.S. government&apos;s reach into their private files and communications need to start thinking about alternatives, no matter how hard it may be to replace Google, Microsoft or Facebook.\nAs the U.S. becomes more hostile toward foreigners under President Donald Trump, there&apos;s no telling why the U.S. government may be asked to collect information. Some travelers to the U.S. are already being asked to reveal their social network histories in a broad search for terrorist connections. What if the government didn&apos;t even have to ask?",
