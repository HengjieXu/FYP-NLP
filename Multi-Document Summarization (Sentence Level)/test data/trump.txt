        "content": "The path to Federal Reserve policy tightening this year has one final hurdle to clear: a potential Donald Trump victory in the U.S. presidential election.\nThe stage appears set for an interest-rate hike next month at the Fed\u2019s last meeting of 2016. Domestic economic data this week, including an acceleration in wage growth, support a move in December. In its Nov. 2 statement, the Fed\u2019s policy committee\u00a0said the case for higher borrowing costs had strengthened\u00a0amid a pickup in the pace of inflation. Traders assign about a 76 percent probability of a rate hike by year-end, according to futures data compiled by Bloomberg.\nYet some strategists say a victory\u00a0by Trump, the Republican nominee, in the Nov. 8 vote may flip the situation. His rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton, is seen as more likely to maintain existing economic policies, while Trump has campaigned on an anti-trade platform and accused the Fed under Chair Janet Yellen of playing politics. Polls show the presidential race\u00a0has tightened as it heads into its final weekend.\nThe December rate-hike probability would \"go to 20 percent or even lower\" if Trump is elected, said Priya Misra, head of global interest-rate strategy in New York at TD Securities (USA) LLC, one of 23 primary dealers that trade with the Fed. \"Equities fall significantly, dollar strengthens, emerging markets fall -- so financial conditions tighten a lot, which will affect growth negatively. The Fed will wait to see how growth responds.\"\nPolicy makers entered 2016 forecasting four rate hikes, after liftoff from near zero in December 2015. Instead, they\u2019ve stood pat and repeatedly pared projections amid uneven domestic economic data and signs of stalling global growth.\nFed Bank of Atlanta President Dennis Lockhart signaled on Friday the central bank was on track to raise rates next month, but hinted that some event risk may prevent officials from pulling the trigger.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a relatively high bar, at least in pure economic terms, a relatively high bar to not moving in December,\u201d Lockhart, who is not a voter on the Fed\u2019s policy committee this year, told reporters in Orlando, Florida. \u201cThere are other things that go on in the world that could give pause and I don\u2019t completely rule them out,\u201d he said, without providing specifics.\nTreasuries rose Friday as traders shifted their focus to the election, overshadowing a Labor Department report showing steady job gains in October as wages rose from a year earlier by the most since 2009. The benchmark 10-year note yield declined to 1.78 percent, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data.\nDomestic economic data suggest the Fed should raise rates in December absent an economic shock stemming from next week\u2019s election, according to Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz SE.\n\"If Donald Trump wins the election, the first if, and if in his acceptance speech he reiterates his anti-trade rhetoric -- so you have two ifs there -- then risk markets will sell off significantly,\u201d El-Erian said Friday in an interview on Bloomberg Television. \"If the two ifs materialize, I would expect a 5 to 10 percent decline in the S&P 500 Index of stocks, with the balance of risks toward even a greater decline.\u201d\nThe 76 percent probability futures traders assign to a December rate hike is up from 69 percent seen a week ago. The probabilities are based on the assumption the effective fed funds rate will trade at the middle of the new range after the central bank\u2019s next hike.\nA Trump presidency \"would be a more uncertain environment,\"\u00a0said Justin Lederer, an interest-rate strategist in New York at Cantor Fitzgerald LP, a primary dealer. \"The Fed would rather wait and see how everything plays out before they make a rate hike, whereas Clinton would be more of status quo.\"\n",

        "content": "Trump Reiterates Pledge to Hike Defense Spending\nPresident Donald Trump said that his defense secretary, James Mattis, will lead a \"great rebuilding\" of the U.S. military, as he visited a new aircraft carrier whose construction in Virginia is delayed and over budget.\nMattis \u201cwill be charged with overseeing this great rebuilding of our military might,\u201d Trump said aboard the U.S.S. Gerald Ford, the first of a new class of aircraft carriers under construction at a Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. shipyard in Newport News, Virginia.\n\u201cWe will have the finest equipment in the world. Planes, ships and every else,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe will give our military the tools you need to prevent war and, if required, to fight war, and to only do one thing. Do you know what that is? Win.\u201d\nTrump has pledged to increase U.S. defense spending, starting with a $30 billion addition to this year\u2019s budget and a $54 billion boost that administration officials announced on Monday for the budget year that begins in October. That increase would be offset by cuts from the rest of the government\u2019s discretionary budget.\nHe has called the U.S. military, the world\u2019s largest, \u201cbadly depleted,\" and made increased defense spending a central plank of his campaign. The U.S. spends more on defense than the next seven countries in the world combined, according to data compiled by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute and the Peter G. Peterson Foundation.\n\u201cI am calling for one of the largest defense spending increases in history,\u201d Trump said, although defense hawks including Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain has said he isn\u2019t proposing enough.\nAdditional surface ships and submarines would benefit the nation\u2019s top warship makers -- Huntington and the marine unit of General Dynamics Corp. Increases in the Army would benefit military vehicle builders General Dynamics and BAE Systems Plc, as well as Lockheed Martin Corp. and Raytheon Co., makers of air defense and anti-armor systems such as Thaad, Patriot and the Javelin.\nTrump pledged in his campaign to expand the Navy\u2019s fleet to 350 vessels from about 272 today, which the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service estimates would cost an average of $4 billion annually for construction alone.\nThe Navy set a goal of 305 ships under Trump\u2019s predecessor, Barack Obama. Ash Carter, Obama\u2019s defense secretary, warned about \"irresponsibly\" exceeding that goal at the risk of sacrificing quality for quantity. But in December, after the election, the Navy echoed Trump in a new assessment, saying it needed as many as 355 ships.\nTrump promised that he\u2019ll provide the \u201ctwelve-carrier Navy we need.\u201d There are 10 carriers in service today. A second ship in the Ford class, the John F. Kennedy, is also under construction.\nThe Ford, the first in the planned new class of three carriers, has been plagued by cost overruns and delays. The $12.9 billion ship was originally scheduled to be delivered in September 2014. The Navy\u2019s latest status report projected delivery in April.\nTrump spoke on the hangar deck of the ship, where a banner read \"Integrity at the Helm,\" the ship\u2019s motto.\n\u201cIt really feels like a place,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou stand on that deck and you feel like you\u2019re standing on a very big piece of land.\u201d\nRead about a review of the Ford carrier\u2019s troubles.\nThe ship is to be equipped with advanced systems from a number of subcontractors, including Raytheon and General Atomics.\n\u201cWith the benefit of hindsight, it was clearly premature to include so many unproven technologies\u201d on the vessel, including systems used for power generation, launching and landing aircraft and its radar and elevators to move munitions, Frank Kendall, who was the Pentagon\u2019s top weapons buyer, said in a memo in August.\n",

        "content": "Sabrina De Sousa\nLisbon, Portugal (AP) -- A former American CIA agent released from prison in Portugal hours before her planned extradition to Italy is thanking President Donald Trump for what she describes as his administration&apos;s intervention in her case.\nSabrina de Sousa told The Associated Press on Thursday that U.S. officials were in contact with authorities in both Portugal and Italy ahead of her release.\nOfficials in the United States and Italy did not immediately comment. The Portuguese Foreign Ministry, in a brief written comment to the AP, said in Portugal the \"legal process is conducted only by judicial authorities, without interference from political powers. That is true for this case.\"\nDe Sousa walked free Wednesday, a day after Italy dropped its extradition request. An Italian court had convicted her of taking part in the kidnapping of a Muslim cleric in Milan 14 years ago as part of the U.S. \"extraordinary rendition\" anti-terrorism program, which was launched after the September 11, 2001 attacks. The program saw suspects kidnapped and transferred to centers abroad, where they were interrogated and often tortured.\nDe Sousa was arrested on a European warrant at Lisbon Airport in October 2015 while en route to India to visit her mother. She repeatedly fought her extradition and complained that former President Barack Obama&apos;s administration had abandoned her.\nShe lost several appeals after her arrest. But on Tuesday, Italian President Sergio Mattarella granted her partial clemency, shaving one year off her four-year sentence. She could now serve community service instead of prison time, possibly in Portugal or Italy.\nAfter her release, de Sousa tweeted to Trump: \"THANKYOU!! Your admin did more on my case in the last 30 days than was done in prior 8 years!\"\nShe directed requests for further details to her spokesman, former Michigan Congressman Peter Hoekstra, who confirmed that the Trump administration was involved. He said in an email to the AP that he worked with \"a number of different agencies/groups within the (Trump) administration,\" as well as some former colleagues in Congress. He did not name anyone.\n\"The administration was totally responsive, professional, focused,\" Hoekstra said, adding that the U.S. embassy in Lisbon was also \"very helpful.\" The embassy did not immediately reply to questions.\nIn evaluating de Sousa&apos;s request for clemency, Mattarella&apos;s office said he took into account \"that the United States has interrupted the practice of extraordinary renditions\" \u2014 a reference to the Obama administration&apos;s decision to halt the program.\nDe Sousa was one of 26 Americans tried and convicted in absentia for the cleric&apos;s kidnapping. Full or partial clemency has been granted in just four of the cases.\n",

The person said Hill \u201cwrote the book\u201d on Putin, a reference to \u201cMr. Putin: Operative in the Kremlin,\u201d a 2013 biography of the Russian leader.\nThe White House offered Hill the job before National Security Adviser Michael Flynn resigned for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of his contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in the days after Trump\u2019s victory, according to the person.\nHill declined to comment on her selection, which was reported earlier by Foreign Policy magazine, when reached by text message on Thursday. Hill was a national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia at the National Intelligence Council, serving under both George W. Bush and Barack Obama.\nHill\u2019s appointment is likely to reassure critics who have said Trump may take too soft a line toward Russia and seek to improve ties at the expense of European allies and the NATO alliance. In an essay she co-authored in October, Hill advocated keeping sanctions in place over Russian aggression in Ukraine and rejected the idea of a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d with Putin in which the U.S. would trade concessions in Ukraine for Russian help in the Middle East.\n\"Great hire,\u201d said Michael McFaul, U.S. ambassador to Russia under Obama. \"Fiona is both a first-class scholar on Russia and an experienced former government official.\u201d\nTrump said before his election that he might lift the U.S. penalties imposed over Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and support for separatists in eastern Ukraine. But optimism in Moscow has slowly faded that Trump\u2019s presidency will mark a new era of cooperation as the new administration has refused to lift sanctions imposed by President Barack Obama and continued to challenge Putin over his alliance with Syria\u2019s President Bashar al-Assad.\n",

        "content": "Two generals who once commanded troops in Iraq helped persuade President Donald Trump to drop that country in a revision of his controversial travel ban.\nDefense Secretary James Mattis and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, both veterans of the two U.S. wars in Iraq, successfully pressed Trump to exclude the country from a 90-day travel ban that originally covered seven mostly Muslim nations in the Middle East and Africa, a White House official said.\nJames Mattis\nMcMaster argued that including Iraq would hinder joint efforts by U.S. and Iraqi forces to combat Islamic State terrorists that control parts of the country and would fail to recognize sacrifices Iraqis made on behalf of U.S. troops, said another White House official.\nThe plight of Iraqi translators who risked their lives to assist U.S. forces in the country and in many cases now seek refuge in the U.S. is a passionate cause for many veterans of the war.\nTrump has described the travel directive as an urgent national security matter but has repeatedly delayed issuing a revised order after a federal court blocked his original plan. It\u2019s now been more than a month since Trump\u2019s original order was issued and the president has put it off until at least Friday, according to two other White House officials, who asked not to be identified discussing the policy decision ahead of its announcement.\nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters at a daily briefing Wednesday that the process has been slowed by consultations with federal agencies that would carry out the order. He declined to say when the new order would be issued.\nThe postponement allows more time for the administration to build political momentum from Trump\u2019s address to Congress on Tuesday night before public attention shifts again to the travel ban.\nTrump and his aides previously had said the threat to the U.S. was so pronounced that they couldn\u2019t take the time for extended consultations across government before issuing an order. Trump\u2019s initial travel ban set off a weekend of chaos at airports and border crossings as hundred of people were detained or delayed in being admitted to the country.\n\u201cThe problem is we would\u2019ve wasted a lot of time, and maybe a lot of lives because a lot of bad people would\u2019ve come into our country,\u201d Trump said at a Feb. 16 press conference, defending his decision to issue the initial order.\nSpicer described the urgency in catastrophic terms on Jan. 31.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know when the next terrorist is going to enter this country. We don\u2019t know when the next bomb\u2019s going to go off,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cAnd the last thing that you want to do is to say well we could\u2019ve done this Saturday, but we waited one more day. Or we wanted to roll it out differently. And someone\u2019s life got lost.\u201d\nThe ban on entry by Iraqi citizens caused consternation for a key U.S. ally in the fight against Islamic State.\nIraqi Prime Minister Haider Al-Abadi turned back a recommendation from angry lawmakers in Parliament to reciprocate by denying access to the U.S. military advisers who are helping in the fight against Islamic State and to American oil workers who support Iraq\u2019s most important industry.\nSaad Al-Hadithi, Abadi\u2019s spokesman, said in a phone interview from Baghdad on Wednesday that the prime minister urged Trump to exclude Iraq from the ban in a phone call two weeks ago. Al-Hadithi said the Iraqi government hadn\u2019t yet received official notice from the Trump administration that the country would be exempted from the revised travel ban.\nMattis and McMaster drew on their deep experience in the region to press the case on Trump.\nDonald Trump with H.R. McMaster.\nAs a lieutenant colonel, Mattis commanded one of the first Marine battalions that went into Iraq during the 1991 Persian Gulf War. By the time of the second war in Iraq he\u2019d rise to major general and led a Marine division that occupied insurgent strongholds in the western Al Anbar province.\nMcMaster, then a captain, commanded a troop of nine Abrams tanks that destroyed more than 80 Republican Guard tanks in a famous battle during the Persian Gulf War. Later, as an army colonel, he commanded a successful campaign in Iraq to clear Tal Afar of insurgents that became a model for counter-insurgency efforts.\nThe revised order will initially keep out citizens of Yemen, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya and Somalia for three months while the government determines whether people from those countries can be sufficiently vetted for terrorist sympathies, the official said.\u00a0\nThe new order will also alter treatment of Syrian refugees, who had been banned indefinitely under the original order. They will now face the same 120-day ban as refugees from other countries, the official said.\n",

Craft declined to comment when reached by phone Wednesday.\nCraft will oversee the relationship with the second-biggest U.S. trading partner after China and would probably play a role as the U.S. seeks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited the White House last week, and Trump mentioned him in a speech before Congress on Tuesday when he highlighted a joint initiative to help female entrepreneurs.\nCraft\u2019s financial disclosure filings may be complex because her husband, Joseph Craft III, is the chief executive officer of Alliance Resources Partners LP, a publicly traded coal company based in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Joseph Craft is a longtime donor to Republican causes.\nThe appointment is the first of several likely to be made in the coming days as Trump fills dozens of ambassadorial posts that have remained empty since he took office on Jan. 20. So far, only one appointee -- David Friedman, nominated to be ambassador to Israel --- has faced a hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and none has been confirmed.\nCraft and her husband contributed $431,000 to Trump Victory, the joint fundraising committee that supported his campaign, the Republican National Committee and state parties, according to\u00a0Federal Election Commission filings. She was also a Kentucky delegate to the Republican National Convention.\nCraft is close friends with U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and his wife, Elaine Chao, the transportation secretary. She is also friends with Vice President Mike Pence and his wife, Karen, who were her guests at a Kentucky Derby event last year.\u00a0\nCraft was a rare establishment Republican who stood by Trump, publicly advocating for him even during a standoff with House Speaker Paul Ryan. During a meeting at Trump Tower in June, Craft and her husband\u00a0sought commitment from Trump that, if elected, he wouldn\u2019t try to oust McConnell or Ryan. Trump assured them he wouldn\u2019t.\n",

Amicus has an experimental drug for a rare disease that it\u2019s trying to get approved by the Food and Drug Administration, though it\u2019s been asked to collect more data by the agency.\n\u201cJoining us in the gallery is a rare disease survivor, Megan Crowley,\u201d Trump said in his address, where he laid out his agenda. Crowley was diagnosed with a rare condition called Pompe disease, prompting her father, John Crowley, who now runs Amicus, to found a company working on the condition, Trump said. He also called for faster approvals by the FDA.\n\u201cOur slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan\u2019s life, from reaching those in need,\u201d the president said.\u00a0Trump has yet to name an FDA commissioner.\nShares of Amicus were up 9.6 percent to $7.12 at 11 a.m. in New York, after earlier surging as much as 15 percent.\nAmicus, based in Cranbury, New Jersey, has one drug approved in Europe, Galafold, for the rare condition Fabry disease. In November, the FDA declined to give the company a fast-track review for the therapy, saying Amicus needed to collect more extensive data. Shares plummeted.\nThe company is also working on drugs for Pompe disease and Epidermolysis Bullosa, a group of rare skin-blistering diseases. On Wednesday, Amicus also reaffirmed its spending forecast for 2017, and said it had $5 million in sales.\nCrowley founded an earlier company, Novazyme Pharmaceuticals, after two of his children were diagnosed with Pompe disease in 1998. Novazyme and its lead asset, a drug for the often-fatal condition, were snapped up by Genzyme Corp. in 2001, and the FDA approved the therapy, Myozyme, in 2006, after just nine months of review.\n",

        "content": "Is Money Pouring In as Trump Claims to Fund NATO?\nPresident Donald Trump declared victory on a key element of his international agenda when he told Congress that \u201cmoney is pouring in\u201d from NATO countries to support the defense alliance, leaving aides to explain the boast.\nTrump said in his joint address to Congress on Tuesday evening that his administration\u2019s \u201cvery strong and frank discussions\u201d are succeeding in prodding NATO allies to boost defense spending. In an aside that was one of his few departures from his prepared text, the president added,\u00a0 \u201cIn fact I can tell you, the money is pouring in. Very nice.\u201d\nNot yet. The idea that money is pouring in appears at odds with the laborious defense budget decisions made by the group\u2019s 28 member nations. White House aides said Wednesday that the progress nonetheless is real, if less immediate than the president suggested.\n\u201cThe response of allies to the case made by the President, the Vice President and the Secretary of Defense (among others) has been overwhelmingly positive,\u201d Michael Anton, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said Wednesday in an email. \u201cWe expect to see stepped up defense spending commitments reflected in their next budget cycles.\u201d\nSpecifically, a White House official who asked not to be identified added that the president was referring to Latvia, Lithuania and Romania, which have outlined plans to meet NATO\u2019s target that every member spend 2 percent of its gross domestic product on defense.\nDuring his presidential campaign, Trump at various points called the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \u201cobsolete\u201d and warned the U.S. might not honor the pledge to defend any member under attack unless other members started paying their fair share of defense costs.\nNATO countries set the 2 percent target for members\u2019 defense spending in 2014. While several countries have increased defense spending in recent years, few meet the 2 percent threshold. The U.S., U.K., Estonia, Poland and Greece were alone among the alliance\u2019s 28 members in meeting that target last year.\nThe latest official figures are due soon: NATO\u2019s annual report, which will include updated details on defense spending, is scheduled to be published on March 13.\nThe White House official said Latvia and Lithuania agreed to reach the NATO goal by 2018 and that Romania plans to hit that level next year. The three nations have moved to bolster their defense in response to Russia\u2019s seizure of Crimea and intervention in Ukraine.\nThe economies of those three countries are among the smallest within the NATO alliance. Together they accounted for 0.4 percent of total defense spending by NATO members in 2016, according to a report released by the alliance.\nIn his speech to Congress, Trump gave his strongest backing yet for NATO while also claiming victory in prodding increased defense spending.\n\u201cWe strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two World Wars that dethroned fascism, and a Cold War that defeated communism,\u201d he said. \u201cBut our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that.\u201d\nCountries including Germany and France have boosted spending on defense, although the increases began before Trump took office. Former President Barack Obama had also prodded -- more gently -- for NATO countries to increase defense spending to meet the target.\nThe issue has moved up the political agenda since Trump\u2019s election victory, with\u00a0NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg saying more must be done in the coming years on \u201cfair burden-sharing.\u201d\n\u201cThe president of the United States and the American people expect our allies to keep their word and to do more in our common defense, and the president expects real progress by the end of 2017,\u201d Vice President Mike Pence said at the NATO headquarters in Brussels last month. \u201cIt is time for actions, not words.\u201d\nNavy Commander Sarah Higgins, a Defense Department spokeswoman, said in an interview Wednesday that Defense Secretary James Mattis held discussions with partners about making a\u201cfair contribution\u201d during the recent NATO Defense Ministerial meeting in Brussels.\n\u201cThat was one of the main messages that we were trying to get across -- that we are committed to NATO but as well we need everyone to have their fair share of the commitment. And the message was well-received.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Why President Trump May Not be Able to Ignore TPP\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s administration has vowed to reshape the global trading system, saying the U.S. would prioritize its trade laws over the World Trade Organization\u2019s rules. America plans to defend its \u201cnational sovereignty over trade policy,\u201d the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative has said in an annual document. All this is moving the WTO back to center stage, as the threat of a global trade war looms.\nAs a candidate, Trump said the WTO was a \u201cdisaster\u201d and threatened to withdraw from the organization. While the comments from Trump\u2019s trade office represent a ratcheting up of the rhetoric, it\u2019s not clear how they\u2019ll translate into action. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said at a press briefing on March 1 that the trade office\u2019s comments aren\u2019t the Trump administration\u2019s official policy and it\u2019s not \u201cwhere we\u2019re going.\u201d Still, Trump\u2019s decision to pull the U.S. from a 12-nation trade pact known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership could bring greater focus to the WTO\u2019s own efforts to negotiate trade agreements.\nCalmly. WTO Director-General Roberto Azevedo, who was appointed to a second four-year term in February, says the organization has the tools to deal with Trump\u2019s concerns. Still, Azevedo warned that a global trade war would be \u201ccatastrophic,\u201d according to an interview with Germany\u2019s Bild newspaper.\nThe WTO is an international body that negotiates, monitors and mediates trade rules among 164 members including the U.S., China, Russia and the European Union. Established in 1994 and based in Geneva, the WTO\u2019s goal is to reduce obstacles to international trade.\nThe WTO\u2019s dispute-settlement system helps ensure that countries don\u2019t take unilateral trade actions against one another -- like raising tariffs or imposing other trade sanctions. The goal is to prevent escalation that can lead to trade wars. WTO members that believe another country\u2019s laws violate the rules can ask the organization\u2019s panel of legal experts to investigate. The WTO first encourages members to resolve their disputes by seeking a settlement through informal discussions. If that\u2019s not possible, the WTO\u2019s dispute-settlement body will study the matter, issue a ruling and, if required, urge guilty parties to bring their laws into compliance.\nFor the most part. Each member agrees to abide by the WTO\u2019s various agreements and the individual terms accepted when it joins.\u00a0All that said, the U.S. agreed to join the organization on the condition that the WTO and its dispute system wouldn\u2019t add to or diminish its obligations and rights. The WTO\u2019s primary legal authority is rooted in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, also known as GATT, which aims to promote international trade in goods. The WTO also has oversight over certain rules related to trade in agriculture, services and intellectual property among other issues.\nThe country that brought the complaint can ask the WTO to authorize retaliatory trade measures.\nA withdrawal from the WTO would be problematic for the U.S. economy and could leave the nation\u2019s companies at a disadvantage. Other countries would be able to unilaterally raise tariffs on U.S. imports and impose burdensome requirements that prevent U.S. companies from competing abroad. The U.S. would also forfeit any ability to overturn unfair trade practices via the WTO dispute-settlement system.\nIt depends. Some cases can be resolved quickly through informal mediation. An efficiently litigated case could take up to three years. Other cases \u2014 like the ongoing aircraft dispute between the U.S. and the EU\u00a0\u2014 can take even longer.\nNot directly. WTO agreements apply to member countries, which create laws that affect citizens and companies. However, WTO rules and dispute rulings can cause countries to alter their laws, which can change the operating environment for companies and any advantages they may enjoy over international competitors.\nThe WTO has no authority over its members\u2019 labor rules, antitrust laws, monetary policies or tax rules as long as such policies do not distort trade or act as a barrier to trade. The WTO has also avoided oversight of economic sanctions against other countries.\nNot if the WTO is working properly. Countries like the U.S. and China are already engaged in tit-for-tat trade skirmishes within the WTO\u2019s dispute system. The threat of a true trade war escalates when countries intentionally bypass WTO rules and ignore its rulings to pursue unilateral trade tariffs or other restrictions.\n",

        "content": "Trump Says Obamacare Is Collapsing and We Must Act\nDuring his first major address to Congress Tuesday, President Donald Trump backed a proposal that has split the Republican Party: giving Americans tax credits to buy coverage.\nTrump\u2019s health-care remarks, midway through the hour-long speech, offered few new policy details but embraced a plan put forward by House Speaker Paul Ryan. A divided Republican Party, along with investors on Wall Street, had been looking for a clear explanation of his intentions for repealing and replacing Obamacare.\n\u201cPresident Trump demonstrated that he and the House are coalescing around a replacement plan, including a tax credit to help individuals buy a health plan that fits their needs,\u201d Ryan said in a statement after the speech. The tax credits Ryan has proposed to help people buy coverage have drawn opposition from conservatives, who worry they would be a new entitlement.\nIn his remarks, Trump reiterated his call to repeal Obamacare -- to which Republicans in the chamber stood and applauded.\u00a0Additional health policy goals from Trump included bringing down drug prices and speeding the \u201cslow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration.\u201d\n\u201cIf we slash the restraints, not just at the FDA but across our government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles,\u201d Trump said, without offering an explanation of what should be done. He has yet to name who will head the FDA.\nHe said he would replace Obamacare with a program that would ensure access to coverage, lower costs and provide better health care -- broad principles that Democrats and Republicans have both called for in the past. Specifically, he called for giving more control of the Medicaid program to states, limiting medical lawsuits, making sure people with pre-existing medical conditions can access coverage, and having insurers sell coverage across state lines.\n\u201cThe way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we are going to do,\u201d Trump said.\nSenator Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia, has indicated a willingness to work with Republicans on Obamacare. He said he liked Trump\u2019s tone, though he wished Trump had called to \u201crepair\u201d the law, as some more moderate Republicans have.\nMajor Republican divisions have emerged on Obamacare. Conservatives have insisted they\u2019ll vote only for a full repeal, void of replacement programs. More moderate GOP members have balked at not including some help for people to afford insurance and a fix to allow the 31 states that expanded Medicaid under Obamacare to continue with a broader program. Trump said during the speech that any program should include a transition for those currently in Obamacare.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing that there are a lot of different ideas,\u201d because that\u2019s how good public policy is made, Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said on Fox & Friends Wednesday morning. He applauded the range of proposals within the Republican party as part of the legislative process, and said Trump will eventually have to take a firmer position on the specifics of a replacement bill.\nThe refundable tax credits proposed by Ryan and backed by Trump Tuesday night have become a major sticking point in the party. At least two heads of conservative groups in Congress said in the last two days they won\u2019t vote for legislation Republican leaders are crafting.\n\u201cAm I for Obamacare repeal? The answer is yes,\u201d said Representative Mark Meadows,\u00a0head of a conservative wing known as the Freedom Caucus, said Tuesday before Trump\u2019s speech. \u201cAm I for this plan? The answer is no.\u201d Representative Mark Walker, who chairs the 170-member Republican Study Committee, also said he couldn\u2019t support the most recent GOP draft plan and won\u2019t recommend his colleagues do so, either.\nWhile Trump\u2019s mention of tax credits may help Republican leaders try to gain backing for their plan in their party, there was a sense that some would hear what they wanted.\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t say refundable tax credit, he said tax credit,\u201d said Representative Mark Sanford, a South Carolina Republican. \u201cThere\u2019s a world of difference between the two.\u201d Conservatives like Sanford oppose refundable credits, which can allow people to receive more money back than they pay in taxes -- essentially creating a new entitlement.\nThere are doubts about whether Trump\u2019s lofty goals for a health program can be achieved. Former Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who helped craft Obamacare in 2009 and 2010, said earlier Tuesday that it would be more than difficult to broaden coverage, lower costs and improve quality all at once.\n\u201cHe\u2019s Trump. He has the magic words,\u201d Baucus said during an interview on Bloomberg Television. \u201cBut, practically, no.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s administration has previously said it was working on its own health plan and would reveal it around mid-March.\n\u201cThis is a plan that we are all working on together; the House, the Senate, the White House,\u201d Ryan said Tuesday. \u201cSo there aren\u2019t rival plans here. We\u2019re all working on this together with the administration.\u201d Top Republicans in Congress have said that they don\u2019t anticipate Democratic help, and will need to reach consensus on their own.\n\u201cWe expect no Democratic support,\u201d Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican who serves as the Senate majority leader, said in an interview on CNN after Trump\u2019s speech.\n",
