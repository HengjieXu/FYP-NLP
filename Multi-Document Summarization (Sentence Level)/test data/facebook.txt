        "content": "Facebook Inc. won dismissal of a lawsuit involving a picture of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and a Syrian refugee that raised questions about the social network\u2019s duty to remove racist comments by its users.\nA German court in the city of\u00a0Wuerzburg rejected an emergency bid by the refugee to force the company to block any post featuring the picture or repeating offensive statements that often accompanied the photograph. The judges said the country\u2019s laws for content providers don\u2019t currently apply to internet platforms like Facebook and lawmakers would need to change the rules to give 19-year-old Anas Modamani the relief he sought.\nThe picture of Modamani and Merkel has become an emblem of the chancellor\u2019s refugee policies. Modamani\u2019s lawyer had told the court it was posted by numerous users who added libelous statements about his client, including falsely alleging he took part in terror attacks or was responsible for the attempted murder of a homeless person.\n\"Facebook didn\u2019t adopt the statements and the postings as its own opinion,\" Presiding Judge Volkmar Seipel said after delivering the ruling. \"It\u2019s not Facebook that\u2019s claiming these things when users are uploading the picture.\"\nModamani\u2019s lawyer,\u00a0Chan-jo Jun, urged politicians to draft new laws that would give additional protections to victims of hate speech.\n\"We need to decide whether to allow Facebook to do whatever it wants -- to keep anything online that elicits traffic,\" Jun said after the ruling. \"Lawmakers need to step in.\"\nMenlo Park, California-based Facebook said that it understands that \"this is a very difficult situation for Mr. Modamani\" and stressed that it is quickly blocking any posts \"accurately\" flagged by Jun.\nHate speech has become an increasingly pressing problem for Facebook globally. But nowhere is the issue more acute than in Germany, where incidents of online hate have soared as the country has absorbed just over one million refugees since the start of 2015. In December 2015, Facebook, Google and Twitter Inc. agreed to remove posts that contain hate speech within 24 hours.\nGerman Justice Minister Heiko Maas has said the companies often fail to meet this target and the government is now mulling tougher legislation.\nTuesday\u2019s ruling may not be the end of the case, however.\nThe\u00a0Modamani decision is partly based on procedural grounds, as the case was filed under emergency procedures. Judge Seipel said that the teenager can refile the complaint under the normal process and the court would look into whether it was feasible for Facebook to search its entire platform for libelous statements or photo montages.\nFacebook users made statements that \u201cseverely violated\" Modamani\u2019s rights and Seipel said it may be asking too much to have the victim alert Facebook about each and every post. If it can be proven that Facebook can find such posts without too much effort, then a court might step in.\n\"But that requires expert witnesses testifying under normal evidence rules,\" said Seipel. \"I can\u2019t just believe what computer experts say in interviews\" in the local press.\nFacebook\u2019s lawyers had previously said during court hearings that such a search is impossible, saying it would require a \"wonder machine\" that doesn\u2019t exist.\nThe case is: LG Wuerzburg, 11 O 2338/16.\n",

        "content": "A German lawsuit over a photo showing a Syrian refugee with Chancellor Angela Merkel\u00a0has put Facebook Inc.\u2019s hate-speech policies under scrutiny. But the high-profile case has also shed light on complaints that the company tries to avoid and delay lawsuits in the country.\nChan-jo Jun, a lawyer for the Syrian refugee suing\u00a0in Wuerzburg to stop Facebook using the picture, is one of a number of attorneys that says the company aggressively relies on procedural tactics to stay out of German courtrooms. He said Facebook routinely failed to reply to emails sent to its European headquarters in Dublin or even its German lawyers.\n\"It was only because of the media attention in this case that Facebook finally decided to send lawyers to Wuerzburg,\"\u00a0Jun said of the case, where a verdict is scheduled for Tuesday. \"They wanted to get access to the files.\"\nThe jurisdictional fights are taking place against a backdrop of wider efforts to crack down on hate speech in Germany, where offensive online posts soared as the country took in more than one million refugees since the start of 2015. The Wuerzburg suit was brought by 19-year-old Anas Modamani after a selfie he took with Merkel was posted on numerous Facebook pages with libelous statements, including claims he took part in terror attacks. Modamani wants Facebook to block any future postings of the picture.\nIn December 2015, Facebook, Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Twitter Inc. agreed to remove posts that contain hate speech within 24 hours. German Justice Minister Heiko Maas has said the companies often fail to meet this target and lawmakers are pondering tougher legislation. State justice ministers are pressing to include rules requiring Internet companies to allow service of suits at a German address.\nMark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s\u00a0chief executive officer, said in a speech in Berlin last year his company needs to do more to combat hate speech.\n\"I think we will continue needing to do a better and better job,\" he said.\u00a0\nOne of the most common complaints from Jun and other lawyers involves attempts to notify Facebook about the lawsuit, known as service of process. Facebook\u2019s European headquarters is in\u00a0Ireland and the German court needs to send lawsuits there unless Facebook allows it to be sent to another address in Germany.\nIf the Wuerzburg court had to rely solely on sending the complaint to Ireland, the case could have been delayed for a year, a judge said at a hearing last month. Two Hamburg lawyers contacted the court on behalf of Facebook only after the lawsuit garnered widespread news coverage.\n\"Until this day, we didn\u2019t get any confirmation our attempt to serve the suit in Ireland went anywhere,\" Presiding Judge Volkmar Seipel said at the hearing. \"I\u2019m not sure we would have been able to make service in Ireland happen this year at all.\"\nRobert Ardelt, a\u00a0German spokesman for Facebook, declined to comment.\nLawyers like Jun say one way for Facebook to show it\u2019s willing to improve would be to make German lawsuits easier by allowing courts to send complaints to their local units.\nBut even if the notification obstacle is overcome, lawyers may confront additional hurdles.\nIn a Berlin case filed by a student whose account was shut without explanation, Facebook told the court it doesn\u2019t speak German and needed an English-language text. Translating the complaint would have cost 500 euros ($530), a lot for a student, the plaintiff\u2019s lawyer Franz Wegener says.\n\"It\u2019s hardly credible that Facebook, which has millions of German users and offers a German website with terms and service communication in German, isn\u2019t able to read court filings in that language,\"\u00a0Wegener says.\nFacebook isn\u2019t the only U.S. company that has tested the patience of German lawyers.\nIn 2014, Google was sued by a group of German publishers over snippets the search engine uses from their products. After the complaint was served in the U.S., German law firm Hengeler Mueller appeared for the search engine in a Berlin court.\nIn a second suit filed a year later over the same issue, the court asked Hengeler Mueller to accept service. The lawyers declined, so the court had to use the formal service process that requires translations via a central authority in the U.S. and takes more time. Ultimately, the same Hengeler lawyers appeared in that case, too.\nRobert Heine, an attorney at Berlin law firm Raue who works for the plaintiffs in both cases, says in-house lawyers for Google\u2019s German unit regularly appear in court for the U.S. company. That shows it\u2019s all one operation and it should be possible to serve suits to the local unit here, he says.\nJun, however, said that Google has done a better job handling complaints from consumers and ordinary citizens, as opposed to the corporate litigation like the two Berlin cases.\nKay Oberbeck, a spokesman for the Google in Germany, said that the Mountain View, California-based company follows the \u201cstandard German civil process\u201d when sued in the country.\n\u201cWe communicate with our users in their local language and we provide templates in their local language in case users want to address any concerns,\" he said.\nNone of the tactics are illegal, U.S. companies are simply invoking rules on\u00a0international judicial proceedings, says Christoph Thole, a professor of civil procedure at Cologne University. The rules aim to protect defendants sued in another country.\n\"But insisting on these rights is sometimes also part of a lawyer\u2019s bag of tricks,\" Thole says. \"If a lot is at stake, you try to make it as troublesome as possible for the other side.\"\nWhether Facebook can claim it doesn\u2019t understand German isn\u2019t entirely clear under European Union rules, according to Thole. If a company is active in Germany, that suggests it understands the local language. \"That issue can\u2019t hinge on whether Mark Zuckerberg speaks German,\" he says.\nAt the February hearing in Wuerzburg, Martin Munz, a lawyer for Facebook, defended his client\u2019s insistence on getting translations.\n\"Facebook is only doing what Siemens AG would do if it was served a suit in Basque,\" Munz said. \"There\u2019s probably someone somewhere at Siemens who understands Basque, but the company has a right to get the complaint in German.\"\n",

        "content": "Attendees demonstrate Oculus Rift headsets and Oculus Touch controllers during the Oculus Connect 3 event in San Jose, Calif.\u00a0on Oct. 6, 2016.\nFacebook Inc.&apos;s Oculus division is looking to get virtual-reality headsets into more homes by way of a significant price drop.\u00a0The social-media company cut the price of its flagship Oculus Rift headset to $499 from $599. It also lowered the price of the Oculus Touch system, a pair of motion-sensing controllers, to $99 from $199.\u00a0Facebook bought\u00a0Oculus for $2 billion in 2014 as part of Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg&apos;s plan to use virtual reality to offer\u00a0richer ways of communicating online. So far, high prices for the hardware have limited adoption to mostly video-game players. Just over 350,000 units were sold in 2016, according to SuperData Research estimates. That&apos;s less than rival products from HTC Corp. and Sony Corp. It&apos;s also a long way from Zuckerberg&apos;s late 2014 goal of 50 million to 100 million units over about a decade, and the more than 1 billion people using\u00a0Facebook&apos;s free social network.\n\"We know that price is definitely one of the concerns,\" Nate Mitchell, Oculus&apos;s head of product, said, while noting improvements in manufacturing and falling component prices let the company pass savings onto consumers.Like some other VR\u00a0devices, the Rift still requires a Windows PC with a powerful graphics processing system. Compatible computers range from about $500 to more than $3,000.\u00a0Sony&apos;s VR headset, which costs $399, requires a connection to a $350 PlayStation 4 gaming console, while the PC-tied HTC Vive costs $799. Alphabet Inc.&apos;s Google and Samsung Electronics Co. offer sub-$100 headsets with less-advanced graphics performance that work with smartphones.\u00a0\nFormer chief engineer and co-founder of Oculus VR Jack McCauley said Facebook&apos;s VR headset is still too expensive, even for gamers. \"When you get above $300, it&apos;s really hard to move product in the gaming world,\" he said.\nEventually, there will be an Oculus system that doesn&apos;t require a separate PC purchase, reducing the cost further.\"We see a future where there will be standalone VR devices out there, it&apos;s definitely in our long-term vision of ubiquitous VR,\" Mitchell said. Oculus showed off a prototype of such a wireless headset in October, but it gave no concrete release date for such a device.\u00a0\nThe Oculus Rift system is not currently compatible with Apple Inc.&apos;s Mac computers, and while Oculus does not have an active team working on this, Mitchell wants Mac support in the long-term.\n",

But we need to fly a lot more and more regularly.\u201d\nThe high-altitude drone, which has a wingspan wider than a Boeing 737 and is powered by four electric engines, had its first test flight in June last year. However, a report by the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board in November said the drone suffered a \u201cstructural failure\u201d as it was coming in for landing.\nAquila\u2019s giant flying wing is solar powered, designed so it can remain aloft for long stretches.\u00a0\nFacebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has been busy devising new ways to connect as much of the world\u2019s population to the internet, which includes leapfrogging ground-based infrastructure limitations and instead beaming connectivity from the sky.\nGoogle parent Alphabet Inc.\u2019s research lab said January it had shut down Titan in early 2016. Google beat Facebook in bidding for Titan Aerospace in 2014, leading Facebook to purchase U.K.-based Aquila, which was already building solar powered airplanes. Project Loon, another Google project to beam internet from high-altitude balloons, is still going.\nAqulia is still in its early stages, said Parikh. While much of the aerospace design is done in a farm in a rural part of Southwest England, the software is developed in Menlo Park, California, and the testing will remain in Arizona. Parikh said that Facebook is also evaluating other test sites.\n",

The bot, which is free to use and doesn\u2019t affect prices or rates offered, will talk users through the process of arranging an international money transfer with TransferWise.\nThe bot will also allow people to set alerts to notify them when a particular foreign exchange rate they are interested in hits a certain level.\nThe service is available for payments to and from the U.S., Canada, Australia, the U.K. and Europe, the company said Tuesday.

        "content": "Snap Makes Its Case to Investors\nSnap Inc. so far hasn\u2019t been able to tamp down investor concern about user growth.\nWhen asked about a slowdown in new users on its Snapchat photo-sharing mobile app in the fourth quarter, the company blamed a product issue with its Android version, according to investors who attended the company\u2019s initial public offering roadshow presentation Tuesday in New York. Investors were skeptical of that answer, especially in light of rising competition from Facebook Inc., whose Instagram app recently launched a clone of Snapchat\u2019s popular stories disappearing-video feature. Instagram\u2019s stories has quickly amassed\u00a0150 million daily active users, just below Snapchat\u2019s 158 million.\n\u201cPointing to problems with Android is not addressing the elephant in the room, which is Instagram,\u201d said Sean Stiefel, a portfolio manager at Navy Capital, who attended the presentation. \u201cThey sort of danced around the issues with user growth.\u201d\nHow quickly the company is adding new users -- and how engaged those users are -- will be top of mind for investors as they weigh whether to buy into Snap\u2019s stock at the $16.2 billion to $18.5 billion market valuation it\u2019s targeting. That\u2019s because the 7-year-old company hasn\u2019t given many details on future plans outside of pushing toward profitability in its flagship Snapchat app.\nClick here to see a visual history of Snapchat\u2019s copycats\nInstagram\u2019s stories, like Snapchat\u2019s, are broadcasts of videos to friends, lasting 24 hours before they disappear. In its presentation Tuesday, Snap sought to differentiate the two apps, telling investors that people tap Instagram for different reasons than they do Snapchat, which they use for their most intimate friendships. But if Instagram\u2019s stories feature does prevent Snapchat from building its audience, Snap will need a more significant explanation than Android product problems when it starts to give quarterly earnings presentations after the IPO.\nChief Executive Officer Evan Spiegel, wearing a suit, tackled other pressing questions at the lunch event at New York\u2019s Mandarin Oriental hotel. The company is aiming to raise as much as $3.2 billion in its IPO, with its shares scheduled to start trading March 2 on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol SNAP.\nAfter doling out entrance badges in the entryway of the 36th-floor ballroom, which was adorned in Snap\u2019s trademark yellow, attendees had about an hour to ask questions and munch on boxed lunches. The room was tightly packed. Several of those who spoke after the meeting said they were impressed with Spiegel, whom they described as polished and prepared.\nThe Los Angeles-based company was asked about its cost structure, which involves heavy spending on cloud infrastructure with Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google division and Amazon.com Inc. Snap has committed to spend $2 billion with Google Cloud over the next five years and\u00a0at least $1 billion with Amazon in the same period.\nAt Tuesday\u2019s road-show meeting, the company said it expects those costs to eventually decline as the tech giants compete on pricing, according to attendees. Snap also said it is open to building its own data centers in the future.\nSpiegel also gave a glimpse of possible new uses for the content captured through the app. The CEO said the company would be capable of building three-dimensional maps of real-world places like Universal Studios or the Harry Potter theme park, according to people who attended the meeting.\nWhile Spiegel didn\u2019t say the company has plans to pursue mapping, the mention of such capabilities is one of the few tastes investors have gotten about potential future businesses for the so-called \u201ccamera company.\u201d\n",

        "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-02-17/mark-zuckerberg-s-manifesto-for-facebook-offers-a-social-dystopia", 
        "content": "Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg&apos;s\u00a0manifesto, penned clearly in response to accusations leveled at the social network in the wake of the bitter U.S. election campaign, is a scary, dystopian document. It shows that Facebook -- launched, in Zuckerberg&apos;s own words five years ago, to \"extend people\u2019s capacity to build and maintain relationships\" -- is turning into something of an extraterritorial state run by a small, unelected government that relies\u00a0extensively on privately held algorithms for social engineering.\nIn 2012, Zuckerberg addressed future Facebook investors in a letter attached to the company&apos;s initial public offering prospectus. Here&apos;s how he described the company&apos;s purpose:\nWhatever those beliefs were based on, they have largely failed the test of time.\u00a0Instead of creating stronger relationships, Facebook\u00a0has spawned anxieties and addictions that are the subject of academic studies from\u00a0Portugal\u00a0to\u00a0Australia.\u00a0Some studies have determined that using Facebook detracts from\u00a0a user&apos;s life satisfaction.\nA Danish\u00a0experiment\u00a0in 2015, involving people weaned from Facebook for a week and a control group that kept using it, showed that people on the social network are 55 percent more likely to feel stressed; one of the sources of that stress is envy of the glossified lives reported by other users. Users&apos; well-being, research has showed, only tends to\u00a0increase\u00a0when they have meaningful interactions -- such as long message exchanges -- with those who are already close to them.\u00a0\nIn his latest manifesto, Zuckerberg uses parenting groups\u00a0as an example of something his company does right. But recent\u00a0research\u00a0shows that some new mothers use Facebook to obtain validation of their self-perception as good parents, and failing to get enough such validation causes depressive symptoms.\nAs for the \"rewired\" information infrastructure, it has helped to chase people into ideological silos and feed them content that reinforces confirmation biases. Facebook actively created the silos by fine-tuning the algorithm that lies at its center -- the one that forms a user&apos;s news feed. The algorithm\u00a0prioritizes\u00a0what it shows a user based, in large measure, on how many times the user has recently interacted with the poster and on the number of \"likes\" and comments the post has garnered. In other words, it stresses the most emotionally engaging posts from the people to whom you are drawn\u00a0-- during an election campaign, a recipe for a filter bubble and, what&apos;s more, for amplifying emotional rather than rational arguments.\nBragging in his new manifesto, Zuckerberg writes: \"In recent campaigns around the world -- from India and Indonesia across Europe to the United States -- we&apos;ve seen the candidate with the largest and most engaged following on Facebook usually wins.\" In the Netherlands today, liberal Prime Minister Mark Rutte&apos;s page has 17,527 likes; that of fiery nationalist Geert Wilders, 174,188. In France, rationalist Emmanuel Macron has 165,850 likes, while far-right Marine Le Pen boasts 1.2 million. Helping them win is hardly something that would make Zuckerberg, a liberal, proud -- but, with his algorithmic interference in what people can see on his network, he has created a powerful tool for populists.\nZuckerberg doesn&apos;t want to correct this mistake and stop messing with what people see on the social network. Instead, the new\u00a0manifesto talks about Facebook as if it were a country or a supranational bloc rather than just a communication-enabling technology. Zuckerberg describes how Facebook sorts groups into \"meaningful\" and, presumably, meaningless ones. Instead of facilitating communication among\u00a0people who are already part of social support groups offline, he wants to project Facebook relationships into the real world: Clearly, that&apos;s a more effective way of keeping competitors at bay.\u00a0\nThe Facebook chief executive says\u00a0his team is working on artificial intelligence that will be able to flag posts containing offensive information -- nudity, violence, hate speech -- and pass them on for final decisions by humans. If past experience is any indication, the overtaxed humans will merely rubber-stamp most decisions made by the technology, which Zuckerberg admits is still highly imperfect. Zuckerberg also suggests enabling every user to apply the filters provided by this technology:\nThe real-life effect will be that most users, too lazy to muck around with settings, will accept the \"majority\" standard, making it even less likely that anything they see would jar them out of their comfort zone. Those who use the filters won&apos;t be much better off: They&apos;ll have no idea what is being filtered out because Facebook&apos;s algorithms are a black box.\u00a0\nZuckerberg\u00a0casts Facebook as a global community that needs better policing, governance, nudging toward better social practices. He&apos;s willing to allow some democracy and \"referendums,\" but the company will make the ultimate decision on the types of content people should see based on their behavior on Facebook. Ultimately, this kind of social engineering affects people&apos;s\u00a0moods\u00a0and behaviors. It can drive them toward commercial interactions or stimulate giving to good causes but it can also spill out into the real world in more troubling ways.\u00a0\nIt&apos;s absurd to expect humility from Silicon Valley heroes. But Zuckerberg should realize that by trying to shape how people use Facebook, he may be creating a monster. His company&apos;s other services -- Messenger and WhatsApp --\u00a0merely allow users to communicate without any interference, and\u00a0that simple function is the source of the least controversial examples in Zuckerberg&apos;s manifesto. \"In Kenya, whole villages are in WhatsApp groups together, including their representatives,\" the Facebook CEO writes. Well, so are my kids&apos; school mates, and that&apos;s great.\nPeople are grateful for tools that help them work, study, do things together -- but they respond to shepherding in unpredictable ways. \u00a0\"Virtual identity suicide\" is one; the trend doesn&apos;t show up in Facebook&apos;s reported usage numbers, but that might be because a lot of the \"active users\" the company reports are actually bots. If you type \"how to leave\" into the Google search window, \"how to leave Facebook\" will be the first suggestion.\u00a0\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\nTo contact the author of this story:          Leonid Bershidsky     at lbershidsky@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story:          Therese Raphael     at traphael4@bloomberg.net\n",
